________________________

In the fall of 2004 the National Election Studies (NES) carried out a time
series study both before and after the 2004 Presidential Election in the
United States.

The number of cases in this Full Release file, 1212, includes all
respondents from both the pre-election and post-election surveys. 
Respondents who completed a pre-election survey but not a post-election
survey are shown as missing in the post-election survey variables.

Accompanying the dataset is codebook documentation containing detailed
variable descriptions, as well as data descriptor statement files that can 
be used to read the raw data file into common data analysis software
packages such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA.



>> 2004 Study Description 
_________________________

The 2004 American National Election Study was conducted by the Center for
Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research, under the general
direction of the Principal Investigators, Nancy Burns and Donald R. Kinder.
Data collection services were provided by the Survey Research Center (SRC)
of the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.

This is the latest in a series of studies of American national elections
produced by the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies. The
study would not have been possible without the financial support of the
National Science Foundation and the University of Michigan (the Center for
Political Studies, the Department of Political Science, the Survey Research
Center, and the Office of the Provost).

The 2004 National Election Study was designed through consultation between
the Principal Investigators, a national Board of Overseers, a specially
appointed Planning Committee, and the NES user community.

Board members during the 2004 National Election Study included John H.
Aldrich (Duke University), Stephen Ansolabehere (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology), Nancy Burns, ex officio (University of Michigan), Russell
Dalton (University of California - Irvine), John Mark Hansen, chair
(University of Chicago), Simon Jackman (Stanford University), Donald Kinder,
ex officio (University of Michigan), Jon A. Krosnick (Ohio State
University), Arthur Lupia (University of Michigan), Diana C. Mutz
(University of Pennsylvania), and Wendy Rahn (University of Minnesota).

Planning Committee members for the 2004 National Election Study included

>> 2004 Study Design, Content and Administration
________________________________________________

>> 2004 STUDY DESIGN

The 2004 National Election Study entailed both a pre-election interview and
a post-election re-interview. A freshly drawn cross section of the
electorate was taken to yield 1,212 cases. The 70-minute pre-election survey
went into the field September 7th, approximately eight weeks before Election
Day. No interviewing was conducted on Election Day, November 2nd. The
65-minute post-election study went into the field the day after the
election, November 3rd, and remained in the field until December 20th.
Further details of the administration of the surveys are given in "2004
STUDY ADMINISTRATION," below.

>> 2004 STUDY CONTENT

Like its predecessors, the 2004 NES was divided between questions necessary
for tracking long-term trends and questions necessary to understand the
particular political moment of 2004.  The study maintains and extends the
NES time-series 'core' by collecting data on Americans' basic political
beliefs, allegiances, and behaviors: aspects of political belief and action
so basic to the understanding of politics that they must be monitored at
every election, no matter the nature of the specific campaign or the broader
setting.  Core consists of: (1) attachments to the parties; (2) evaluations
of incumbents and their challengers; (3) opinions on political issues; (4)
ideological identification and political values; (5) general attitudes
toward democratic procedure and the political system; (6) engagement and
participation in politics; (7) immersion in mass media; (8) identification
with and attitude toward social groups; and (9) social background.

The study also carried topical and study-specific instrumentation. Questions
covering issues prominent in 2004 addressed job outsourcing, private
investment of Social Security funds, and President Bush's tax cut.
Americans' views on foreign policy, the war on terrorism, and the Iraq War
and its consequences were also addressed.  In addition, the study carried
expanded instrumentation on inflation, immigration, gender politics, and gay
and lesbian politics.  It also extended the experiment on the measurement of
voter turnout that began in 2002.  A special feature was the incorporation
of the module on representation and accountability, Module 2, from the
Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), at the end of the Post-
election interview.

Finally, a mergeable ancillary file of contextual data is an additional
component of the 2004 election study.  The file, available by the summer of
2005, contains 435 records representing all House districts.  It includes
biographical information, district and state descriptive variables, and
other data related to the 2004 election and its candidates. 

>> 2004 STUDY ADMINISTRATION

The pre-election survey began on September 7th, 2004 and ended November 1st,
2004. No interviewing was conducted on Election Day, November 2nd. The
post-election reinterviews began on November 3rd, 2004 and ended
December 20th, 2004.

Data collection was conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) of the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. All interviewing was
conducted face-to-face using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)
technology. The CAPI instrument was programmed using Blaise, a software
package developed by Statistics Netherland. All interviews were conducted
in English, as there were no translations of the questionnaire to a language
other than English.

The pre-election study sample was released all at once at the beginning of
the field period. All individuals who completed a pre-election interview
were contacted to be interviewed again in the post-election study. The
post-election design was managed as a "quick take," with as many completions
gained as close to Election Day as possible.

For interview proper (defined as the portion of the interview after the
front end, but prior to the interviewer observations), the pre-election
study ran approximately 70 minutes per interview, and the post-election
study approximately 65 minutes per interview. Both studies made use of
respondent booklets, and the post-election study also made use of ballot
cards.  Randomization was used extensively throughout both the pre-election
and post-election questionnaires, for purposes of randomizing order within
batteries or question series, application of half-sampling to some
questions, and random ordering of question blocks.

The sample for the 2004 study was comprised of 2,374 cases, a freshly drawn
cross section intended to be nationally representative of the electorate.
All respondents were United States citizens aged 18 years or older by
election Day (November 2nd, 2004).

Users are advised to become familiar with the weight variables provided in
the dataset, and apply them as appropriate to their analyses to correct for
non-response and other sampling issues.

Final disposition codes for each case were provided by the data collection
organization, coded to categories identified in the American Association for
Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Standards and Best Practices guide. The
citation for the AAPOR document is:

        The American Association for Public Opinion Research. 2000.
        Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome
        Rates for Surveys.  Ann Arbor, Michigan: AAPOR.

Cases were divided into eligible and non-eligible categories, where unknown
eligibility was grouped with eligible cases.  All interviews were fully
completed, with no partial interviews accepted.  Eligible (or unknown
eligibility) cases that did not provide an interview were categorized as
non-response.  The sample of 2,374 cases yielded 1,833 cases that were
considered eligible.  Of special note among these are cases representing
households with no person available who spoke English, and for which no
multi-lingual interviewer was available to determine eligibility.  Such
cases were categorized as eligible non-response, since eligibility was
uncertain. Regardless, an interview could not have been conducted for these
cases because the 2004 questionnaire was only available in English. The
sample yielded 1,212 pre-election interviews and 622 non-response cases (429
of which were refusals). 1,066 pre-election respondents went on to also
provide a post-election interview (146 non-response in the Post, including
91 refusals).

2004 Election Study Response Rates

                 Interviews  Eligible    Response Rate
------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Election          1212      1833             66.1%
Post-Election         1066      1212             88.0% 

The Pre-Election response rate of 66.1% is calculated as the total number of
Pre-Election interviews over the total number of eligible (and unknown
eligibility) cases in the sample.  The Post-Election response rate of 88.0%
is a re-interview rate, calculated as the total number of Post-Election
Interviews over the total number of Pre-Election Interviews. (Note: these
response rates are unweighted. Double samples and other such techniques were
not employed in the 2004 study.)

The field and study staff implemented a number of strategies throughout
the study to bolster response rates.

1) In the pre-election study:

Households were sent advance mailings by first class mail in a stamped 9.5
by 13.5 inch padded manila envelope, with a hand-signed letter, a brochure,
a $5 bill, and a University of Michigan refrigerator magnet enclosed. A
respondent incentive of $20 per interview was initially offered to all
cases. Households were contacted and screened face-to-face.

Cases that showed resistance to interview were usually mailed a letter
tailored to their reason for resistance.  A refusal conversion attempt was
then made.

Near the end of the pre-election study, on October 20th, a two-day UPS
mailing containing a hand-signed letter was sent to all outstanding sample
lines that did not have a hard appointment set; the letter offered an
increased incentive of $50 per interview.

2) In the post-election study:

Respondents received an advance hand-signed letter by first class mail in
a stamped 9.5 by 13.5 inch padded manila envelope. As an incentive for their
post-election interview, respondents were offered the same dollar amount as
they received in the pre-election study, and respondents were paid by the
interviewer at the time of the interview.  During the first two weeks of the
post-election study, interviewers were allowed to contact households by
telephone in order to set up an appointment to interview at a convenient
time, although all interviewing was conducted face-to-face.

As in the pre-election study, cases that showed resistance to interview were
usually mailed a letter tailored to their reason for resistance. A refusal
conversion attempt was then made.

3) Interviewer incentives:

Throughout both the pre-election and post-election study a number of
interviewer and team leader incentive strategies were implemented, including
monetary incentives for meeting management goals at different junctures
during the study period.


>> 2004 Special note about Texas House Incumbents
_________________________________________________

Names of candidates were preloaded into the post-election survey instrument
following identification of the respondent's Congressional district. 
(District identification was supplied by Marketing Systems group in
combination with staff research.)

In general, candidates are identified as House incumbents in this file to
establish the context of pre-existing association with the respondent.
Incumbents are thus regarded as candidates that are (already) in office in
representation of a district at the time of the 2004 election, where
district is regarded as a geographic location rather than a political unit.  
The extent of Texas redistricting from 108th to 109th Congressional district
boundaries consistently produced 2004 House races with incumbent candidates
running to represent areas where he or she had provided little or no
previous representation.  Consequently, no Texas candidate has been
identified as a (true)incumbent for any 109th Congressional district, as
neither the running nor retiring incumbent for the district.  All Texas
Congressional races have been considered open races, all Texas candidates
have been given candidate codes corresponding to nonincumbent candidates,
and retiring Texas House incumbents were not associated with any new
district as the retiree.


>> 2004 National Election Study Sample Design
_____________________________________________

>> STUDY POPULATION

The study population for the 2004 National Election Study (NES) is defined
to include all United States citizens of voting age on or before the 2004
Election Day.  Eligible citizens must have resided in housing units in the
forty-eight coterminous states.  This definition excludes persons living in
Alaska or Hawaii and requires eligible persons to have been both a United
States citizen and eighteen years of age on or before the 2nd of November
2004.

>> MULTI-STAGE AREA PROBABILITY DESIGN

The area sample is based on a multi-stage area probability sample selected
from the Survey Research Center's (SRC) 1990 National Sample design. 
Identification of the 2004 NES sample respondents was conducted using a four
stage sampling process: a primary stage sampling of U.S. Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (MSAs) or New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)
and non-MSA counties, followed by a second stage sampling of area segments,
a third stage sampling of housing units within sampled area segments and
concluding with the random selection of a single respondent from selected
housing units.  A detailed documentation of the 1990 SRC National Sample,
from which the 2004 NES sample was drawn, is provided in the SRC
publication titled 1990 SRC National Sample: Design and Development.  

The 2004 NES sample design called for an entirely new cross-section sample
to be drawn from the 1990 SRC National Sample.    The 1990 SRC National
Sample is a multi-stage area probability sample.  The 2004 NES sample was
drawn from both the 1990 SRC National Sample strata (MSA PSUs) and the 1980
SRC National Sample strata  (non-MSA PSUs).  The modification of the 1990
design in which the 1980 strata definitions were used for the non-MSA
counties fully represents the non-MSA domain of the 48 contiguous states. 
This modification was made for cost and interviewing efficiency reasons
related to the availability of interviewers in these areas who work on some
of SRC's large panel studies.  The following sections will focus on the 1990
SRC National Sample design.
         
Selection Stages for the 2004 NES Sample: 1990 SRC National Sample

- Primary Stage Selection

The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSUs) for the 1990 SRC
National Sample, which depending on the sample stratum are either MSAs, New
England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs), single counties, independent
cities, county equivalents or groupings of small counties, is based on the
county level 1990 Census Reports of Population and Housing[1].  Primary
stage units were assigned to 108 explicit strata based on MSA/NECMA or
nonMSA/NECMA status, PSU size, Census Region and geographic location within
region.  Twenty-eight of the 108 strata contain only a single
selfrepresenting PSU, each of which is included with certainty in the
primary stage of sample selection.  The remaining 80 non-selfrepresenting
strata contain more than one PSU.  From each of these nonselfrepresenting
strata, one PSU was sampled with probability proportionate to its size (PPS)
measured in 1990 occupied housing units. 

The full 1990 SRC National Sample of 108 primary stage selections was
designed to be optimal for surveys roughly three to five times the size of
the 2004 NES.  To permit the flexibility needed for optimal design of
smaller survey samples, the primary stage of the SRC National Sample can be
readily partitioned into smaller subsamples of PSUs such as a one-half
sample or a three-quarter sample partition.  Each of the partitions
represents a stratified sub-selection from the full 108 PSU design.  The
2004 NES sample of 44 PSUs is a stratified random subsample of PSUs from the
"A" half-sample partition of the 1990 SRC National Sample.  Because of the
small size of this NES sample, both the number of PSUs (selected primary
areas) and the secondary stage units (area segments) in the National
half-sample were reduced by sub-selection for the 2004 NES sample design. 
The 18 self-representing areas in the 1990 SRC National half-sample were all
retained for the 2004 NES sample (8 of these remained self-representing in
the 2004 NES and 10 represent not only their own MSA but their "pair" among
the twenty additional self-representing primary areas of the full 1990 SRC
National Sample design).  Nineteen of the 26 nonself-representing
half-sample MSAs and 7 of the 14 half-sample non-MSAs were retained by the
sub-selection for the 2004 NES sample (or 26 of 40 NSR PSUs).  

- Second Stage Selection of Area Segments

The second stage of the 1990 SRC National Sample, used for the 2004 NES
sample, was selected directly from computerized files that were extracted
for the selected PSUs from the 1990 U.S. Census summary file series STF1-B. 
These files (on CD Rom) contain the 1990 Census total population and housing
unit (HU) data at the census block level.  The designated second stage
sampling units (SSUs), termed "area segments", are comprised of census
blocks in both the metropolitan (MSA) primary areas and in the rural areas
of non-MSA primary areas.  Each SSU block or block combination was assigned
a measure of size equal to the total 1990 occupied housing unit count for
the area.  SSU block(s) were assigned a minimum measure of 72 total HUs per
MSA SSU and a minimum measure of 48 total HUs per non-MSA SSU.   Second
stage sampling of area segments was performed with probabilities
proportionate to the assigned measures of size (PPS).  
         
For the 2004 NES sample the number of area segments used in each PSU varies. 
In the self-representing (SR) PSUs the number of area segments varies in
proportion to the size of the primary stage unit, from a high of 12 area
segments to a low of 6 area segments.

For the 2004 NES sample the number of area segments used in each PSU varies. 
In the self-representing (SR) PSUs the number of area segments varies in
proportion to the size of the primary stage unit, from a high of 12 area
segments to a low of 6 area segments in smaller self-representing PSUs [2].

- Third Stage Selection of Housing Units: 2004 NES Sample

For each area segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing had
been made of all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the
segment.  For segments with a very large number of expected housing units,
all housing units in a sub-selected part of the segment were listed.  The
final equal probability sample of housing units for the 2004 NES sample was
systematically selected from the housing unit listings for the sampled area
segments.  

The 2004 NES sample design was selected from the 1990 SRC National Sample to
yield an equal probability sample of 2,756 listed housing units.  This total
included 2,366 housing units for the main sample and three reserve
replicates of 130 cases each.  Table A below shows the assumptions that were
used to determine the number of sample housing units.  The overall
probability of selection for 2004 NES cross-section sample of households was
f=0.00002575 or 0.2575 in 10,000.  The equal probability sample of
households was achieved for the 2004 NES sample by using the standard
multistage sampling technique of setting the sampling rate for selecting
housing units within area segments to be inversely proportional to the PPS
probabilities used to select the PSU and area segment (Kish, 1965).

- Fourth Stage Respondent Selection: 2004 NES Sample
  
Within each sampled 2004 NES occupied housing unit, the SRC interviewer
prepared a complete listing of all eligible household members.  A single
respondent was then selected at random to be interviewed. Regardless of
circumstances, no substitutions were permitted for the designated
respondent.  

>> SAMPLE DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OUTCOMES

The 2004 National Election Study sought a total of 1200 in-person
interviews.  It was estimated that this would require a NES sample draw of
2,366 housing units.  This assumed an occupancy/growth rate of 0.83, an
eligibility rate of 0.94 and a response rate of 0.65.  These assumptions
were based on the 2000 NES field experience.  The overall 2004 NES area
sample design specifications, assumptions and outcomes appear in Table A,
below.  A sample of 2,756 listed housing units was actually selected for the
2004 NES study. This allowed for three reserve replicates of 130 cases each. 
Use of half-open intervals in the field led to the addition of 8 additional
lines. These were housing units that were not identified during the listing
stage, but were located between the selected housing unit and the next unit
on the original listing. The use of this procedure insures full coverage of
housing units.
         
A comparison of the 2004 NES sample outcome figures to the design
specifications and assumptions in table A below shows that the actual
occupancy, eligibility, and response rates were very close to the expected
rates.

>> POST-ELECTION SAMPLE OUTCOMES

Of the 1,212 respondents interviewed in the Pre-Election Study, 1,066
completed Post-Election interviews for an overall response rate of 0.88.  

>> WEIGHTED ANALYSIS OF THE 2004 NES DATA

The 2004 NES data set includes a person-level analysis weight, which
incorporates sampling, nonresponse and post-stratification factors. Analysts
interested in developing their own nonresponse or stratification adjustment
factors must request access to the necessary sample control data from the
NES Board.

>> CONSTRUCTION OF ANALYSIS WEIGHTS

Household Selection Weight Component

Each household selected for the 2004 NES had an equal probability of
selection. The inverse of this probability results in an inflation factor of
38,832.4 for each household in the sample.

Person-Level Sample Selection Weight Component

Within sample households a single adult respondent is chosen at random to be
interviewed.  Since the number of eligible adults varies from one household
to another, the random selection of a single adult introduces inequality
into respondents' selection probabilities.  In analysis, a respondent
selection weight should be used to compensate for these unequal selection
probabilities.  The person-level selection weight is the product of the
household selection weight and the within household selection weight.  The
within household selection weight is equal to the number of eligible persons
in the household and is capped at 3. The use of the respondent selection
weight is strongly encouraged, despite past evaluations that have shown
these weights to have little significant impact on the values of NES
estimates of descriptive statistics. 

Nonresponse Adjusted Selection Weight

The base weight equals the product of the selection weight and the household
level nonresponse adjustment factors. Nonresponse adjustment cells for the
2004 NES sample were formed by crossing MSA status by the four Census
regions.  A nonresponse adjustment factor equal to the inverse of the
response rate in each cell was applied to the interview cases.  Table B
below shows the response rates and nonresponse adjustment factors for the
2004 NES.

Post-stratification factor

The 2004 NES weights are post-stratified to 2004 CPS March Supplement
proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) education categories.    Table C
shows the weighted estimates and proportions for the 24 cells for the 2004
CPS and the 2004 NES.  The post-stratification adjustment is computed by
dividing the CPS weighted total by the 2004 NES total weighted by the
nonresponse adjusted selection weight.  The final two columns show the NES
weighted totals using the final post-stratified analysis weight and the
resulting percents, which match the CPS percents.

Final Analysis Weights

The final analysis weight is the product of the household level non-response
adjustment factor, the number of eligible persons, and a person-level
post-stratification factor.  The final analysis weight for the 2004 NES
sample is scaled to sum to 1212, the total number of respondents.  This
weight is trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles and then re-scaled to
match the 2004 CPS proportions for the 24 age-by-education cells.
         
Post-Election Attrition Weight

The 1,066 Post-Election cases were post-stratified to 2004 CPS March
Supplement proportions for six (6) ages by four (4) education categories
(the same categories used for post-stratifying the Pre-Election cases).  The
post-stratification compensates for differential non-response by age group
and education level.  Response rates for the Post-Election Study ranged from
a high of 100 percent for persons 70 or older with some college to a low of
58 percent for persons age 30 – 39 who did not graduate from high school. 
The panel attrition weight for the Post-Election Study is the product of the
Pre-Election final weight and the post-stratification factor formed by
dividing the CPS proportion by the weighted NES proportion for each of the
24 age by education cells.  The weight is scaled to sum to the number of
cases, 1,066.

>> PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLING ERROR ESTIMATION

The 2004 NES sample design is based on a stratified multi-stage area
probability sample of United States households.  Although smaller in scale,
the NES sample design is very similar in its basic structure to the
multi-stage designs used for major federal survey programs such as the
Health Interview Survey (HIS) or the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The
survey literature refers to the NES, HIS and CPS samples as complex designs,
a loosely-used term meant to denote the fact that the sample incorporates
special design features such as stratification, clustering and differential
selection probabilities (i.e., weighting) that analysts must consider in
computing sampling errors for sample estimates of descriptive statistics and
model parameters.  This section of the 2004 NES sample design description
focuses on sampling error estimation and construction of confidence
intervals for survey estimates of descriptive statistics such as means,
proportions, ratios, and coefficients for linear and logistic linear
regression models.  

Standard analysis procedures in software systems such as SAS and SPSS assume
simple random sampling (SRS) or equivalently independence of observations in
computing standard errors for sample estimates.  In general, the SRS
assumption results in underestimation of variances of survey estimates of
descriptive statistics and model parameters.  Confidence intervals based on
computed variances that assume independence of observations will be biased
(generally too narrow) and design-based inferences will be affected
accordingly.  

Sampling Error Computation Methods and Programs

Over the past 50 years, advances in survey sampling theory have guided the
development of a number of methods for correctly estimating variances from
complex sample data sets. A number of sampling error programs which
implement these complex sample variance estimation methods are available to
NES data analysts.   The two most common approaches to the estimation of
sampling error for complex sample data are through the use of a Taylor
Series Linearization of the estimator (and corresponding approximation to
its variance) or through the use of resampling variance estimation
procedures such as Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) or Jackknife Repeated
Replication (JRR).  New Bootstrap methods for variance estimation can also
be included among the resampling approaches.  See Rao and Wu (1988).

1.  Taylor series linearization method:

When survey data are collected using a complex sample design with unequal
size clusters, most statistics of interest will not be simple linear
functions of the observed data.  The linearization approach applies Taylor's
method to derive an approximate form of the estimator that is linear in
statistics for which variances and covariances can be directly and easily
estimated (Woodruff, 1971).  SUDAAN and Stata are two commercially available
statistical software packages that include procedures that apply the Taylor
series method to estimation and inference for complex sample data. SAS has
also recently added procedures that make use of the Taylor series
linearization method.

SUDAAN  (Research Triangle Institute, 2001) is a commercially available
software system developed and marketed by the Research Triangle Institute of
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (USA).  SUDAAN was developed as a
stand-alone software system with capabilities for the more important methods
for descriptive and multivariate analysis of survey data, including:
estimation and inference for means, proportions and rates (PROC DESCRIPT and
PROC RATIO); contingency table analysis (PROC CROSSTAB); linear regression
(PROC REGRESS); logistic regression (PROC LOGISTIC); log-linear models (PROC
LOGLINK); and survival analysis (PROC SURVIVAL).  The latest versions of
SUDAAN permit procedures to be called directly from the SAS system. 
Information on SUDAAN is available at the following web site address:
http://www.rti.org.

Stata  (StataCorp, 2003) is another commercially available software system
for analysis of complex sample survey data and has a growing body of
research users.  Stata includes special versions of its standard analysis
routines that are designed for the analysis of complex sample survey data. 
Special survey analysis programs are available for descriptive estimation of
means (SVYMEAN), ratios (SVYRATIO), proportions (SVYPROP) and population
totals (SVYTOTAL).  Stata programs for multivariate analysis of survey data
currently include linear regression (SVYREGRESS), logistic regression
(SVYLOGIT) and probit regression (SVYPROBT).  Information on the Stata
analysis software system can be found on the Web at: http://www.stata.com.
         
SAS versions 8 and higher have added several procedures for the analysis of
survey data. Programs for the estimation of means (PROC SURVEYMEANS) and
linear regression models (PROC SURVEYREG) have been included in the STAT
module. Other procedures planned for version 9 include procedures for
estimating totals and proportions (PROC SURVEYFREQ) and for logistic
regression models (PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC).     

2.  Resampling methods:

BRR, JRR and the bootstrap comprise a second class of nonparametric methods
for conducting estimation and inference from complex sample data.  As
suggested by the generic label for this class of methods, BRR, JRR and the
bootstrap utilize replicated subsampling of the sample database to develop
sampling variance estimates for linear and nonlinear statistics.  WesVar 
(Brick et al., 2002) is a commercially available software system for
personal computers that employs replicated variance estimation methods to
conduct the more common types of statistical analysis of complex sample
survey data.  WesVar  was developed by Westat, Inc. Information about WesVar
is available from Westat's Web site: http://www.westat.com/.  WesVar
includes a Windows-based application generator that enables the analyst to
select the form of data input (SAS data file, SPSS for Windows data base,
dBase file, ASCII data set) and the computation method (BRR or JRR methods). 
Analysis programs contained in WesVar provide the capability for basic
descriptive (means, proportions, totals, cross tabulations) and regression
(linear, logistic) analysis of complex sample survey data.  

These new and updated software packages include an expanded set of user
friendly, well-documented analysis procedures.  Difficulties with sample
design specification, data preparation, and data input in the earlier
generations of survey analysis software created a barrier to use by analysts
who were not survey design specialists.  The new software enables the user
to input data and output results in a variety of common formats, and the
latest versions accommodate direct input of data files from the major
analysis software systems.   Readers who are interested in a more detailed
comparison of these and other survey analysis software alternatives are
referred to Cohen (1997).

Sampling Error Computation Models

Regardless of whether linearization or a resampling approach is used,
estimation of variances for complex sample survey estimates requires the
specification of a sampling error computation model.  NES data analysts who
are interested in performing sampling error computations should be aware
that the estimation programs identified in the preceding section assume a
specific sampling error computation model and will require special sampling
error codes.  Individual records in the analysis data set must be assigned
sampling error codes that identify to the programs the complex structure of
the sample (stratification, clustering) and are compatible with the
computation algorithms of the various programs.  To facilitate the
computation of sampling error for statistics based on 2004 NES data,
design-specific sampling error codes will be routinely included in all
public-use versions of the data set.  Although minor recoding may be
required to conform to the input requirements of the individual programs,
the sampling error codes that are provided should enable analysts to conduct
either Taylor Series or Replicated estimation of sampling errors for survey
statistics.

Two sampling error code variables are defined for each case based on the
sample design primary stage unit (PSU) and area segment in which the sample
household is located.

Sampling Error Stratum Code 

The Sampling Error Computation Stratum Code (digit 1 of V040103) is the
variable that defines the sampling error computation strata for all sampling
error analysis of the NES data.  Each self-representing (SR) design stratum
is represented by one sampling error computation stratum.   Pairs of similar
nonself-representing (NSR) primary stage design strata are "collapsed"
(Kalton, 1977) to create NSR sampling error computation strata.  Since there
was an uneven number of nonself-representing MSA and non-MSA strata used in
the 2004 NES, and since it was felt that a nonself-representing MSA PSU
should be paired with a non-MSA PSU, one of each of these PSUs stands alone
within its Sampling Error Stratum Code.

For the 1990 SRC National Sample design, controlled selection and a
"one-per-stratum" PSU allocation are used to select the primary stage of the
2004 NES national sample.  The purpose in using controlled selection and the
"one-per-stratum" sample allocation is to reduce the between-PSU component
of sampling variation relative to a "two-per-stratum" primary stage design.
Despite the expected improvement in sample precision, a drawback of the
"one-per-stratum" design is that two or more sample selection strata must be
collapsed or combined to form a sampling error computation stratum. 
Variances are then estimated under the assumption that a multiple PSU per
stratum design was actually used for primary stage selection.  The expected
consequence of collapsing design strata into sampling error computation
strata is the overestimation of the true sampling error; that is, the
sampling error computation model will yield estimates of sampling errors
which in expectation will be slightly greater than the true sampling error
of the statistic of interest.  
         
SECU - Stratum-specific Sampling Error Computation Unit code (last 2 digits
of V040103) is a half sample code for analysis of sampling error using the
BRR method or approximate "two-per-stratum" Taylor Series method (Kish and
Hess, 1959).  Within the SR sampling error strata, the SECU half sample
units are created by dividing sample cases into random halves, SECU=1 and
SECU=2. The assignment of cases to half-samples is designed to preserve the
stratification and second stage clustering properties of the sample within
an SR stratum. Sample cases are assigned to SECU half samples based on the
area segment in which they were selected.  For this assignment, sample cases
were placed in original stratification order (area segment number order) and
beginning with a random start entire area segment clusters were
systematically assigned to either SECU=1 or SECU=2.

In the general case of nonself-representing (NSR) strata, the half sample
units are defined according to the PSU to which the respondent was assigned
at sample selection (with the exception of the two unpaired NSR strata
mentioned above).  That is, the half samples for each NSR sampling error
computation stratum bear a one-to-one correspondence to the sample design
NSR PSUs.  The particular sample coding provided on the NES public use data
set is consistent with the "ultimate cluster" approach to complex sample
variance estimation (Kish, 1965; Kalton, 1977).  Individual stratum, PSU and
segment code variables may be needed by NES analysts interested in
components of variance analysis or estimation of hierarchical models in
which PSU-level and neighborhood-level effects are explicitly estimated.

>> 2004 Note on Confidential Materials
______________________________________

Starting with the 1986 Election Study, NES has released occupation code
variables in less detail than preceding years.  The full release of
this dataset includes a two-digit code with 25 categories corresponding
to 2000 Census Bureau occupational groupings.  Those who need the full
occupation code for their research should contact the NES project staff for
information about the conditions under which access may be provided.  

The National Election Studies have also not included information for
census tracts or minor civil divisions since 1978, and since 2000 county
and PSU identification have no longer been made available. Permission to use 
detailed geographic information for scholarly research may be obtained from
the Board of Overseers.  More information about this is available from NES 
project staff. 

Note that coding of the full religious denomination variable is in some
cases based on alphabetic "other, please specify" variables, which are
restricted for reasons of confidentiality, although access may be provided
to legitimate scholars under established NES procedures. 

Finally, the National Election Studies have traditionally contained several
minutes of open-ended responses (for example, the candidate likes and
dislikes).  These questions are coded by the SRC coding section according to
master code schemes.  Other scholars have developed alternative or
supplemental coding schemes for such questions (for example, the levels of
conceptualization, released as ICPSR 8151).  The Board of Overseers wishes
to encourage these efforts but in ways which respect the NES and SRC
obligation to protect the privacy and anonymity of respondents. 
Circumstances under which individuals may have access to transcribed
versions of these questions have been worked out and those interested should
contact the NES project staff for further details.

with a single logical record for each respondent. Records are in comma-
delimited ASCII format with variable names comprising the first data line. 

The data collection was processed according to standard processing
procedures.  The data were checked for inconsistent code values which, when
found, were corrected or recoded to missing data values. Consistency checks
were performed.  Annotation was added by the processors for explanatory
purposes.

NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ACTUAL NES VARIABLE

LINE 02
Contains identifiers, including (left to right) the variable name, the
question "tag" or item number (Q9a), and the variable label.  Since the
variable label begins with the question tag, the question tag only appears
once, as part of the variable label.

LINES 05-08
This describes who is being asked the question, inverse to the INAP
conditions (lines 34-35).  Each line ending with ":" describes one condition
that has been met to reach this question.
"/" at the end of a line is equivalent to an "OR" between the condition
preceding and the condition following the "/".  In this example, respondents
who were asked this question were respondents who 1) said they voted, and
who 2) said they voted specifically for President, and who 3) voted for a
major party Presidential candidate OR for another party's candidate.  Note
that a corresponding "/" sometimes appears in the question text when
question wording varies according to which of the OR conditions applies. See
lines 12-17.

LINES 12-17
Several conventions are observed in codebook presentation of question text.
1) Text bracketed between ">" and "<" (line 12, line 15) indicates that
   case-specific text was loaded onto the instrument by the survey
   application.
   In this example, ">NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<" indicates that either 
   "Democratic" or "Republican" was loaded into the question text, 
   depending up which major party candidate R indicated he had voted for
   earlier in the questionnaire   
2) Text bracketed between "[" and "]" (lines 12-14; line 15) displays
   text options, separated by "/".  In this example, the first option is for
   Rs who had voted for a major party candidate; the first 2 sentences read
   to these respondent are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY< 
   Presidential candidate in 2004. How well has the >NAME OF MAJOR PARTY<
   party performed over the past four years?"
   On the other hand, in this example, if R voted for another party's
   candidate, the first 2 sentences are:
  "You've indicated that you voted for the >NAME OF OTHER PARTY< party in
   2004. How well has that party performed over the past four years?"
3) Text in parentheses (line 17) is read at the interviewer's discretion.
4) Text in CAPS, other than text bracketed with ">" "<" per 1), indicates
   words or phrases that appeared underlined in the instrument for emphasis.
   In this example (lines 16-17), the words "very good", "good", "bad", and 
   "very bad" had appeared underlined for interviewer emphasis..

LINE 21
With few exceptions, interviewer instructions appear in the instrument
immediately following the question text.

LINES 34-35
INAP describes the specific paths of all respondents whom the instrument
skips over the question.  Each condition which results in a skip is listed,
separated by ";".>> 2004 Variable Description List
