>> 1996 NATIONAL PRE/POST-ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE DESIGN

STUDY POPULATION

     The study population for the 1996 National Pre/Post-Election Study (NES)
is defined to include all United States citizens of voting age on or before
the 1996 Election Day.  Eligible citizens must have resided in housing units
in the forty-eight coterminous states.  This definition excludes persons
living in Alaska or Hawaii and requires eligible persons to have been both a
United States citizen and eighteen years of age on or before the 5th of
November 1996.

MULTI-STAGE AREA PROBABILITY SAMPLE DESIGN

     The 1996 NES is based on a multi-stage area probability sample selected
from the Survey Research Center's (SRC) National Sample design.
Identification of the 1996 NES sample respondents was conducted using a four
stage sampling process--a primary stage sampling of U.S. Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (MSAs) or New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)[1]
and counties, followed by a second stage sampling of area segments, a third
stage sampling of housing units within sampled area segments and concluding
with the random selection of a single respondent from selected housing units.
A detailed documentation of the 1980 SRC National Sample, from which the 1996
NES Panel was originally drawn is provided in the SRC publication titled 1980
SRC National Sample: Design and Development.  A detailed documentation of the
1990 SRC National Sample, from which the 1996 NES  Cross-section supplement
was drawn, is provided in the SRC publication titled 1990 SRC National Sample:
Design and Development.

     The 1996 NES sample design called for a 1996 NES Panel component
consisting of all respondents to the 1994 NES study, originally drawn from the
1980 SRC National Sample, and a 1996 NES Cross-section component drawn from
the 1990 SRC National Sample.  Although both of these SRC National Samples are
multi-stage area probability samples as described above, there are differences
in specific details at the various stages of the two SRC National Samples
which will be described below.

Figure 1 shows in schematic detail the original sources of the components
of the 1996 NES Sample.  On this figure the "n" indicated in the 1992 and 1994
boxes is actually the number of Respondents from that year and component that
became the Panel component two years later.  Of course the "n" shown for the
1996 NES Panel and Cross-section components does not refer to 1996 Respondents
but, for the 1996 Panel, to the total number of sample eligible households
(i.e. the total of the Respondents from both components of 1994) and, for the
Cross-section supplement, to the total selected number of listed housing units
used in the 1996 NES.

Selection Stages for the 1996 NES Panel Component: 1980 SRC National Sample[3]

Primary Stage Selection: 1996 NES Panel Component

     The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSUs), which depending on
the sample stratum are either MSAs, single counties or groupings of small
counties, is based on the county-level 1980 Census Reports of Population and
Housing.  Primary stage units were assigned to 84 explicit strata based on
MSA/non-MSA status, PSU size, and geographic location.  Sixteen of the 84
strata contain only a single self-representing PSU, each of which is included
with certainty in the primary stage of sample selection.  The remaining 68
nonself-representing strata contain more than one PSU.  From each of these
nonself-representing strata, one PSU was sampled with probability
proportionate to its size (PPS) measured in 1980 occupied housing units.

     The full SRC National Sample of 84 primary stage selections was designed
to be optimal for surveys roughly two to three times the size of the 1994 NES.
To permit the flexibility needed for optimal design of smaller survey samples,
the primary stage of the SRC National Sample can be readily partitioned into
smaller subsamples of PSUs such as a one-half sample or two-thirds sample
partition.  Each of the partitions represents a stratified subselection from
the full 84 PSU design.  The one-half partition of the 1980 National Sample
(i.e., the "A" primary sampling units or PSUs) includes 11 of the 16
self-representing MSA PSUs and a stratified subsampling of 34 of the 68
nonself-representing PSUs of the SRC National Sample.  The two-thirds
partition includes all of the "A" PSUs plus "B1" PSUs, i.e., 5 additional
self-representing PSUs and 11 additional nonself-representing PSUs.

     Since the 1994 NES desired comparison of data over time from 1992 NES
respondents, as well as a representative sample of eligible 1994 respondents,
the 1994 NES sample design included both a Panel and a Cross-section
component.  The Panel component of the 1994 design consisted of all[4]
respondents from the NES Cross-section component of the 1992 NES sample.  The
1994 NES Cross-section component was a new selection of respondents from an
area probability sample of households taken from the two-thirds partition of
the SRC National Sample.  The Panel component of the 1996 NES sample consists
of all 1994 respondents from both of these 1994 NES components.  See Figure 1.

     Due to sample design decisions in 1992, when the NES sample moved from
using the one-half sample partition to the two-thirds sample partition of the
SRC National Sample, the Cross-section portion of the 1992 NES sample included
a disproportionate number of selections from segments in "B1" PSUs (see Table
1).  This same disproportionate distribution was, of course, reflected in the
Panel component of the 1994 NES sample and, thus carried to the 1996 NES
Panel.  While this led to some statistical inefficiency in the form of
increased variance of survey estimates relative to that of an even
distribution across the two-thirds partition primary areas, since the "BI"
PSU areas do represent a proper subsample of the 1980 National Sample design,
separate longitudinal analysis of the 1996 NES Panel (i.e., analysis of
combined 1994 Panel and 1994 Cross-section data)[5] can be undertaken.

     Table 1 identifies the PSUs for the Panel component of the 1996 National
Election Study by MSA status and Region.  The "B1" PSUs in the Panel portion
of the sample design which received the disproportionate allocation in 1992 to
supplement the half-sample are also indicated on this table as well as the
number of area segments carried over to the 1996 NES Panel component (see next
section); all PSUs on this table are proportionately represented in the 1994
NES two-thirds Cross-section Sample.

Second Stage Selection of Area Segments: 1996 NES Panel Component

     The second stage of the 1994 NES National Sample was selected directly
from computerized files that were prepared from the 1990[6] Census file
(PL94-171 file on CD Rom) which contains the block-level 1990 Census total
housing unit (HU) data.  The designated second-stage sampling units (SSUs),
termed "area segments", are comprised of census blocks in the metropolitan
(MSA) primary areas and either census blocks or enumeration districts (EDs) in
the rural areas of non-MSA primary areas.  Each SSU block, block combination
or enumeration district for non-MSA PSUs was assigned a measure of size equal
to the total 1980 occupied housing unit count for the area.  MSA SSU block(s)
were assigned a minimum measure of 72 1990 total HUs per SSU; non-MSA SSU
blocks were assigned a minimum measure of 50 1980 occupied HUs per SSU.
Second stage sampling of area segments was performed with probabilities
proportionate to the assigned measures of size (PPS).

     A three-step process of ordering the SSUs within the primary areas
produced an implicit stratification of the area segments in the second stage
sampling frame, stratified at the county level by geographic location and
population.  Area segments were stratified within county at the Minor Civil
Division (MCD) level by size and income, and at the block and ED level by
location within the MCD or county. (For details, refer to the SRC publication,
1980 National Sample: Design and Development.)

     For the 1994 NES combined Panel/Cross-section sample the number of area
segments used in each PSU varied.  In the self-representing (SR) PSUs the
number of sample area segments varied in proportion to the size of the primary
stage unit, from a high of 12 Cross-section and 7 Panel area segments in the
self-representing New York MSA, to a low of 4 Cross-section and no Panel area
segments in the smaller self-representing PSUs such as Pittsburgh and Boston
MSAs.  Most Nonself-representing (NSR) PSUs were represented by 6
Cross-section and 2 Panel area segments except for "B1" PSUs for which there
are either 5 or 6 Panel segments.  A total of 554 area segments were selected
for the 1994 NES, 191 Panel and 363 Cross-section segments, 157 in the sixteen
self-representing PSUs and 397 in the nonself-representing PSUs as shown in
the last column of Table 1.

     In most cases, both 1994 NES Cross-section and 1994 NES Panel selections
were made from the same area segments within each PSU, so in actual fact a
total of 376 distinct 1980 National Sample area segments were used for the
1994 NES Post-election Study.  Of these, 364 segments had respondents in 1994
and were carried over to the Panel component of the 1996 NES Study.

Third Stage Selection of Housing Units: 1996 NES Panel Component

     For each area segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing
was made of all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the
segment.  For segments with a very large number of expected housing units, all
housing units in a subselected part of the segment were listed.  The final
equal probability sample of housing units for the 1994 NES was systematically
selected from the housing unit listings for the sampled area segments.

     The Cross-section component of the 1994 NES sample design was selected
from the 1980 SRC National Sample to yield an equal probability sample of
households.   The distribution  of the 1994 NES Cross-section sample is that
required by the two-thirds design of the 1980 SRC National Sample.  The
overall probability of selection for 1994 NES Cross-section households was
f=0.00001885 or 0.1885 in 10,000.  The equal probability sample of households
was achieved for the 1994 NES Cross-section design by using the standard
multi-stage sampling technique of setting the sampling rate for selecting
housing units within area segments to be inversely proportional to the PPS
probabilities used to select the PSU and area segment.[8]

     The 1994 NES Panel consisted of all 1005 respondents for whom a complete
interview was obtained in the 1992 NES Cross-section sample.  Respondents in
1994 from both the 1994 Cross-section and the 1994 Panel comprise the 1996 NES
Panel.

Fourth Stage Respondent Selection: 1996 NES Panel Component

     Within each sampled 1994 NES Cross-section housing unit, the SRC
interviewer prepared a complete listing of all eligible household members.
Using an objective procedure described by Kish (1949)[9] a single respondent
was then selected at random to be interviewed.  Regardless of circumstances,
no substitutions were permitted for the designated respondent.  This technique
had also been used in 1992 to select the original Panel respondents.  In 1994
the same Panel respondent (R) was sought for interview as had been interviewed
in 1992.  The 1996 Panel consists of all 1994 NES respondents for whom a
complete interview was obtained in the 1994 NES Combined Cross-section and
Panel sample.  1795 interviewed respondents make up the 1996 NES Panel
component.

Selection Stages for the 1996 NES Cross-section Supplement: 1990 SRC National
Sample

Primary Stage Selection: 1996 NES Cross-section Supplement

     The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSUs) for the 1990 SRC
National Sample, which depending on the sample stratum are either MSAs, New
England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs), single counties, independent
cities, county equivalents or groupings of small counties, is based on the
county-level 1990 Census Reports of Population and Housing.[10]  Primary stage
units were assigned to 108 explicit strata based on MSA/NECMA or non-MSA/NECMA
status, PSU size, Census Region and geographic location within region.
Twenty-eight of the 108 strata contain only a single self-representing PSU,
each of which is included with certainty in the primary stage of sample
selection.  The remaining 80 nonself-representing strata contain more than one
PSU.  From each of these nonself-representing strata, one PSU was sampled with
probability proportionate to its size (PPS) measured in 1990 occupied housing
units.

     The full 1990 SRC National Sample of 108 primary stage selections was
designed to be optimal for surveys roughly three to five  times the size of
the 1996 NES.  To permit the flexibility needed for optimal design of smaller
survey samples, the primary stage of the SRC National Sample can be readily
partitioned into smaller subsamples of PSUs such as a one-half sample or a
three-quarter sample partition.  Each of the partitions represents a
stratified subselection from the full 108 (representing the coterminous United
States as does the NES study) PSU design.  The  one-half sample partition of
the 1990 National Sample was designed to be roughly comparable in number of
PSUs to the two-thirds partition of the 1980 National Sample.  The one-half
partition of the 1990 National Sample (i.e., the "A" primary sampling units or
PSUs) includes 18 of the 28 self-representing MSA PSUs and a stratified
subsampling of 40 of the 80 nonself-representing PSUs of the SRC National
Sample.  The remaining PSUs are divided in half and designated as either B1 or
B2.  The three-quarter partition includes all of the "A" PSUs plus "B1" PSUs,
i.e., five additional self-representing PSUs and twenty additional
nonself-representing PSUs.

    Since the 1996 NES desired comparison of data over time from 1994 NES
respondents, as well as a supplement of eligible 1996 respondents, the 1996
NES sample design includes both a Panel and a Cross-section component.  The
Panel component of the 1996 NES design consists of all respondents from the
both the Panel and the Cross-section components of the 1994 NES sample.[11]
The 1996 NES Cross-section supplement component is a new selection of
respondents from an area probability sample of households taken from the
one-half partition of the new 1990 SRC National Sample.  Since emphasis in
the 1996 NES Study was to be on the Panel component and a rather small number
of 1996 NES Cross-section respondents was sought, a subselection was made from
the non-self representing PSUs in the 1990 half-sample partition; seven
nonself-representing MSA PSUs and seven non-MSA PSUs were randomly eliminated.

     Table 2 identifies the 44 PSUs in the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement
by MSA status and Region and also indicates the number of area segments used
for the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement (see next section on second stage
selection).

Second Stage Selection of Area Segments: 1996 NES Cross-section Supplement

     The second stage of the 1990 SRC National Sample, used for the 1996 NES
Cross-section supplement, was selected directly from computerized files that
were extracted for the selected PSUs from the 1990 U.S. Census summary file
series STF1-B.  These files (on CD Rom) contain the 1990 Census total
population and housing unit (HU) data at the census block level.  The
designated second-stage sampling units (SSUs), termed "area segments", are
comprised of census blocks in both the metropolitan (MSA) primary areas and in
the rural areas of non-MSA primary areas.  Each SSU block or block combination
was assigned a measure of size equal to the total 1990 occupied housing unit
count for the area; SSU block(s) were assigned a minimum measure of 72 1990
total HUs per MSA SSU and a minimum measure of 48 total HUs per non-MSA SSU.
Second stage sampling of area segments was performed with probabilities
proportionate to the assigned measures of size (PPS).

     Prior to the second-stage selection, the SSUs were ordered or implicitly
stratified within each selected PSU. Block Groups were stratified by household
income and, within these income groups, by geography (county, tract, and
block).  Counties within MSA PSUs having more than one county were ordered by
size and distance from the central city of the MSA. (For details, refer to the
SRC publication, 1990 National Sample: Design and Development.)

     For the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement the number of area segments
used in each PSU varies.  In the self-representing (SR) PSUs the number of
area segments varies in proportion to the size of the primary stage unit,
from a high of 13 area segments in the self-representing New York MSA and
12 area segments in Los Angeles MSA, to a low of 4 area segments in the
smaller self-representing PSUs such as Cleveland, Miami-Hialeah or
Nassau-Suffolk MSAs. All nonself-representing (NSR) PSUs were represented by 4
area segments each.  A total of 210 NES Cross-section area segments were
selected, 106 in the 18 self-representing PSUs and 104 in the
nonself-representing PSUs as shown in Table 2.

Third Stage Selection of Housing Units: 1996 NES Cross-section Supplement

     For each area segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing
was made of all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the
segment.  For segments with a very large number of expected housing units,
all housing units in a subselected part of the segment were listed.  The final
equal probability sample of housing units for the 1996 NES Cross-section
supplement was systematically selected from the housing unit listings for the
sampled area segments.

     The Cross-section supplement of the 1996 NES sample design was selected
from the 1990 SRC National Sample to yield an equal probability sample of 803
listed housing units.  The 1996 NES Cross-section supplement drawn was ten
percent larger than the expected required sample size of 730 lines to allow
for additional "reserve" sample replicates to be released if necessary to meet
interview goals.   The overall probability of selection for 1996 NES
Cross-section households was f=0.000007500 or 0.07500 in 10,000.  The
equal probability sample of households was achieved for the 1996 NES
Cross-section supplement by using the standard multi-stage sampling technique
of setting the sampling rate for selecting housing units within area segments
to be inversely proportional to the PPS probabilities used to select the PSU
and area segment.[14]

Fourth Stage Respondent Selection: 1996 NES Cross-section Supplement

     Within each sampled 1996 NES Cross-section housing unit, the SRC
interviewer prepared a complete listing of all eligible household members.
Using an objective procedure described by Kish (1949)[15] a single respondent
was then selected at random to be interviewed.  Regardless of circumstances,
no substitutions were permitted for the designated respondent.  This technique
had also been used in 1992 and 1994 to select the original Panel respondents.
In 1996 the same Panel respondent (R) was sought for interview as had been
interviewed in 1992 and 1994.

1996 NES SAMPLE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

     The 1996 Pre/Post-election Study sought a total of 1750 interviews in the
Pre-election phase, all of which were to be contacted for reinterview in the
Post-election phase.

THE PRE-ELECTION PHASE:

     The 1996 NES sample design included both Panel and  Cross-section
components for the Pre-election phase, but emphasis in the 1996 NES design was
on obtaining a maximum number of Panel interviews.  To this end, the 1996 NES
Panel component  included the full set of 1795 1994 NES respondents, 1036 from
the 1994 NES Cross-section component and 759 from the 1994 NES Panel
component. Given sample design assumptions for the 1996 NES Panel of an
eligibility rate of 0.98 and response rate of 0.75, this component was
expected to yield 1320 interviews in 1996.

     The 1996 NES Cross-section supplement was intended to yield 430
interviews. It was estimated that this would require a NES Cross-section
sample draw of 730 housing units.  This assumed an occupancy/growth rate of
0.86, an eligibility rate of 0.95 and a response rate of 0.72.  The overall
1996 NES Pre-election sample Design is set out in Table 3, below.

Sample Design, and Assignment of Replicates

     The Cross-section supplement of the 1996 NES sample was drawn from the
recently listed "A" or half-sample partition of the 1990 SRC National Sample.
Because of the small size of this NES sample component, both the number of
PSUs (selected primary areas) and the Secondary Selection Units (area
segments) in the National half-sample were reduced by subselection for the
1996 NES sample design.[16]  The 18 self-representing areas in the 1990 SRC
National half-sample were all retained for the Cross-section supplement (8 of
these remained self-representing in the half-sample and 10 represent not only
their own MSA but their "pair" among the twenty additional self-representing
primary areas of the full 1990 SRC National Sample design).  Nineteen of the
26 non-selfrepresenting MSAs and 7 of the 14 non-MSAs were retained for the
1996 NES Cross-section supplement (or 26 of 40 NSR PSUs).

     The number of second stage units (SSUs or area segments) was also reduced
for the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement.  In self-representing PSUs, the
number of segments was reduced by one-half with a minimum of four segments in
any PSU.  In the nonself-representing PSUs, the number of segments was reduced
to two-thirds, from six to four segments per PSU.  This resulted in a total of
210 segments or SSUs from which the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement was
selected.
There could be no reduction of the total number of segments or of persons in
the 1996 NES Panel component since all 1994 NES respondents were to be
recontacted for interview in 1996.  The number of area segments represented by
the 1795 respondents to the 1994 study eligible for the 1996 NES Panel was
364.

     Both the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement and the 1996 NES Panel were
divided by segment into two replicate samples.  Replicates 1 and 2 of the 1996
NES Cross-section supplement each included 105 segments.  The original
replicate assignment of Panel segments also resulted in an even division of
those segments by replicate.

1996 NES Cross-section Supplement Selection and  Assignment of Releases

     The 1996 NES Cross-section supplement drawn was ten percent larger than
the expected required sample size of 730 listed housing units to allow for
additional "reserve" sample replicates.  Final number of housing units in the
Cross-section supplement was 803 spread over the 210 area segments as outlined
below.

     Selected lines in each of the two replicates were divided into two equal
parts to accommodate 4 quarterly releases.  The quarterly releases were
designed to assess effect on voter opinion formation of news events which
occurred at various times over the course of the study.  The first replicate
sample was divided into release 1 and 2; the second replicate sample into
release 3 and 4.  An additional two reserve releases (5 and 6) equal to 73
lines, or 10% of the total 1996 NES Cross-section supplement, were also drawn
from Replicate 2 to be released with releases 3 and 4, if necessary to meet
study interview goals.  Both reserve releases 5 and 6 were, in fact, released.

     Although Replicates 1 and 2 are each made up of different area segments
(except as modified by the request to include Panel Rs needing tracking in
Releases 1 and 2), all 1996 NES Cross-section and Panel Primary Areas are
included in each Replicate if they contained more than a single segment.  In
contrast to the assignment of replicates by area segment, releases were
originally specified in the 1996 NES sample design to be assigned across the
HU-level file, rather than by area segment so any segment having more than
one selection will have the selections distributed across Releases 1 and 2
(or 3, 4, 5 and 6 for Replicate 2 segments). In order to increase the
efficiency of the field interviewing effort, original releases 3 and 4 were
later revised such that their assignment was based on area segment, rather
than across all Replicate 2 segments.

     A comparison of the total design figures compared to the Pre-election
outcome figures in Table 4 indicates the following:  for the 1996 NES Panel
component, where there was no option for reserve releases, and where primary
field effort was placed, eligibility and response rates equal to those
anticipated resulted in a number of completed interviews very close to that
projected by the sample design.  On the other hand, for the 1996 NES
Cross-section supplement, even with the release of reserve replicates, a lower
than expected response rate resulted in a seven percent shortfall in number of
completed interviews.  Since the Cross-section supplement made up less than
one-quarter of the total sample design, the overall shortfall in number of
completed interviews was only two percent.

THE POST-ELECTION PHASE:

     The study design for the 1996 Post-election component of the NES Study
called for recontact of all respondents to the 1996 NES Pre-election survey
(both those originally in the Panel component and those in the Cross-section
supplement.)  The Post-election phase of the 1996 NES included a mode
experiment  which called for the random assignment, by area segment, of the
majority of these respondents, to be recontacted after the election for an

interview either by phone or in person.  Those to be excluded from this mode
experiment were those respondents either 1) who were interviewed by phone
during the Pre-election study or 2) who were known to not have a phone.  The
assignment to either the phone or the in-person mode was made on the basis of
segment, such that approximately half of the Post-election recontacts made by
phone and the other half in person.  Since the Post-election phase of the
study involved no new respondents--all respondents were considered Panel
respondents for this phase.  A combined recontact and response rate of 85% was
assumed for the Post-election phase of the 1996 NES to yield a total of 1460
interviews.

     Of the total of 1714 interviews completed for the 1996 Pre-election
study, the sample released for Post-election recontact was distributed as
shown in Table 5. Post-election interview outcome is also shown on this table.
The combined recontact and response rate exceeded expectations resulting in a
total number of Post-election interviews over the 1460 goal.

>> 1996 - WEIGHTED ANALYSIS OF 1996 NES DATA

     The 1996 NES data set includes two final person-level analysis weights
which incorporate sampling, nonresponse and post-stratification factors.  One
weight (variable #4) is for longitudinal micro-level analysis using the 1996
NES Panel. The other weight (variable #3) is for analysis of the 1996 NES
combined sample (Panel component cases plus Cross-section supplement cases).
In addition, a Time Series Weight (variable #5) which corrects for Panel
attrition was constructed.  This weight should be used in analyses which
compare the 1996 NES to earlier unweighted National Election Study data
collections.  Analysts interested in developing their own nonresponse or
post-stratification adjustment factors must request access to the necessary
sample control data from the NES Board.

CONSTRUCTION OF ANALYSIS WEIGHTS

Sample Selection Weight

     The area probability sample design for the 1996 NES results in an equal
probability sample of U.S. households.  However, within sample households a
single adult respondent is chosen at random to be interviewed.  Since the
number of eligible adults may vary from one household to another, the random
selection of a single adult introduces inequality into respondents' selection
probabilities.  In analysis, a respondent selection weight should be used to
compensate for these unequal selection probabilities.  The value of the
respondent selection weight is exactly equal to the number of eligible adults
in the household from which the random respondent was selected.  The use of
the respondent selection weight is strongly encouraged, despite past
evaluations which have shown these weights to have little significant impact
on the values of NES estimates of descriptive statistics.

Household Nonresponse Adjustment Factor

     Nonresponse adjustment factors were constructed at the household level
separately for Panel and Cross-section component cases.  Nonresponse
adjustment cells for the relatively small 1996 NES Cross-section supplement
were formed by crossing PSU type (Self-representing, Nonself-representing MSA
or non-MSA) by the four Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).
A nonresponse factor equal to the inverse of the response rate in each cell
was applied to the interview cases.

     For the larger number of Panel cases, 1996 nonresponse adjustment cells
were initially formed by crossing PSU type by the nine Census divisions
(New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South
Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and Pacific).
However, in order to have a minimum of approximately 25 cases in each
nonresponse adjustment cell, some cells were collapsed across Census Divisions
in the same Census Region.  Tables 6 and 7 show the 1996 nonresponse
adjustment factors for the Cross-section supplement and for the Panel
respectively.  The 1996 NES Panel nonresponse prior to 1996 was reflected in
the 1994 full sample weight which was used to construct 1996 NES Panel final
sample weights.

1996 Combined NES Post-stratification Factor

     As a first step in post-stratifying the sample to 1990 Census
proportions, an  intermediate weight for the 1996 NES combined sample
(Cross-section plus Panel cases) was constructed as follows.  First an
intermediate weight for Cross-section supplement cases was constructed by
multiplying the 1996 Cross-section nonresponse adjustment (Table 6) by the
number of eligible persons in the sample household[19] by an inflation factor
which is the 1995 estimated U.S. households divided by the number of eligible
households (97,061,000/661).  This initial weight was used to produce a
weighted sex by age group  by Census Region table for the 1996 NES
Cross-section supplement.  The age categories used were:  18-44 years, 45-64
years, and 65+ years.  Post-stratification factors were constructed to match
the sample proportions in the 24 sex by age by Region cells to the July 1995
Census population projections (Current Population Reports, P25-1111, Table 4)
by dividing the Census total by the weighted sample estimate for each post-
stratification cell.  Because of the small number of Cross-section supplement
cases, it is not intended that Cross-section only analysis be undertaken.

     An intermediate weight factor for the 1996 NES Panel cases was similarly
constructed by multiplying the 1996 nonresponse adjustment (Table 7) by the
1994 full sample weight times the reciprocal of the constant used to center
the 1994 weights (1993 estimated U.S. population 18 or more years of age /
number of 1994 respondents).[20]  For the 1996 NES Panel respondents, the
number of eligible persons in the household and nonresponse prior to 1996 was
reflected in the 1994 full sample weight.  The last element in this
computation was necessary to restore the Panel intermediate weight to its full
representation of the population.  This intermediate weight was used for Panel
cases to produce a weighted sex by age group by Census Region table as
described above.  Again, post-stratification weights were constructed to match
the sample proportions in the 24 sex by age group by Census Region cells to
the July 1995 Census population projections.

1996 NES Panel Post-Stratification Factor

     For 1996 NES combined Panel and Cross-section analysis, the proportion of
respondents contributed to the total sample was adjusted for by multiplying
the Panel case intermediate weight  by the proportion of Panel cases
(1316/1714) and multiplying the Cross-section case intermediate weight by the
proportion of Cross-section cases (398/1714).  Thus a combined Cross-section
and Panel post-stratification weight was produced, by dividing the 1995 Census
estimated totals in the 24 sex by age group by Census Region cells by the
corresponding weighted estimates for the combined sample.  The figures for
this combined post-stratification factor are shown in Table 8.  It is these
figures, centered as explained below, which are used for the final 1996
combined sample weight (V3).  The final analysis weight (V4 ) for longitudinal
analysis of the 1996 NES Panel is the product of the 1994 full sample weight,
the 1996 Panel household nonresponse adjustment factor,  and the Panel
post-stratification factor.

FINAL ANALYSIS WEIGHTS

     The final analysis weights are the product of the household level
non-response adjustment factor, the number of eligible persons, the sample
selection (inflation) weight and the post-stratification factor.  The final
analysis weight for the Panel-only analysis (V4)  is centered so that the
sum of the weights is equal to the total number of Panel respondents, 1316.
The final analysis weights for the combined 1996 NES sample (V3) sums to
1714, the total number of respondents.  These weights were constructed using
the 1996 NES Pre-election data set.  The nonresponse and attrition between the
Pre and Post-election studies are not incorporated.

CONSTRUCTION OF TIME SERIES WEIGHT

     The 1996 NES Panel consists of 759 respondents originally selected for
the 1992 NES Pre-election Study (1994 NES Panel) and 1036 respondents
originally selected for the 1994 NES Study (1994 NES Cross-section). All of
the 1005 1992 Post-election respondents were eligible for the 1994 NES Panel
and 759 of these responded in 1994 and remained eligible for the 1996 NES
Panel.  Of these 759 respondents from the 1992 NES (1994 Panel), 597 were
interviewed for the 1996 NES.  Of the 1036 respondents from the 1994
Cross-section, 719 were interviewed in 1996 for an overall 1996 NES Panel
response rate of 1316/1795 or 0.733.[22]

>> 1996 PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLING ERROR ESTIMATION

     The 1996 NES sample design is based on a stratified multi-stage area
probability sample of United States households.  Although smaller in scale,
the NES sample design is very similar in it basic structure to the multi-stage
designs used for major federal survey programs such as the Health Interview
Survey (HIS) or the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The survey literature
refers to the NES, HIS and CPS samples as complex designs, a loosely-used term
meant to denote the fact that the sample incorporates special design features
such as stratification, clustering and differential selection probabilities
(i.e., weighting) that analysts must consider in computing sampling errors for
sample estimates of descriptive statistics and model parameters.  This section
of the 1996 NES sample design description focuses on sampling error estimation
and construction of confidence intervals for survey estimates of descriptive
statistics such as means, proportions, ratios, and coefficients for linear and
logistic linear regression models.

     Standard analysis software systems such SAS, SPSS, OSIRIS assume simple
random sampling (SRS) or equivalently independence of observations in
computing standard errors for sample estimates.  In general, the SRS
assumption results in underestimation of variances of survey estimates of
descriptive statistics and model parameters.  Confidence intervals based on
computed variances that assume independence of observations will be biased
(generally too narrow) and design-based inferences will be affected
accordingly.

Sampling Error Computation Methods and Programs

     Over the past 50 years, advances in survey sampling theory have guided
the development of a number of methods for correctly estimating variances from
complex sample data sets. A number of sampling error programs which implement
these complex sample variance estimation methods are available to NES data
analysts.  The two most common approaches to the estimation of sampling error
for complex sample data are through the use of a Taylor Series Linearization
of the estimator (and corresponding approximation to its variance) or through
the use of resampling variance estimation procedures such as Balanced Repeated
Replication (BRR) or Jackknife Repeated Replication(JRR).  New Bootstrap
methods for variance estimation can also be included among the resampling
approaches. See Rao and Wu (1988).

1.  Linearization Approach

     If data are collected using a complex sample design with unequal size
clusters, most statistics of interest will not be simple linear functions of
the observed data.  The objective of the linearization approach is to apply
Taylor's method to derive an approximate form of the estimator that is linear
in statistics for which variances and covariances can be directly estimated.
(Kish, 1965; Woodruff, 1971).  Linearized variance approximations are derived
for estimators of ratio means (Kish and Hess, 1959); finite population
regression coefficients and correlation coefficients (Kish and Frankel,
1974); and many other non-linear statistics.  Software packages such as SUDAAN
and PC CARP (see below) use the Taylor Series linearization method to estimate
standard errors for the coefficients of logistic regression models.  In these
programs, an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to compute
maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters.  At each step of the model
fitting algorithm, a Taylor Series linearization approach is used to compute
the variance/covariance matrix for the current iteration's parameter estimates
(Binder, 1983).

     Available sampling error computation software that utilizes the Taylor
Series linearization method includes:  STATA, SUDAAN and PC SUDAAN, SUPERCARP
AND PC CARP, and CLUSTERS.  PC SUDAAN, PC CARP and STATA include procedures
for estimation of sampling error both for descriptive statistics such as
means, proportions, totals and for parameters of commonly used multivariate
models (least squares regression, logistic regression).

2.  Resampling Approaches

      In the mid-1940's, P.C. Mahalanobis (1946) outlined a simple replicated
procedure for selecting probability samples that permits simple, unbiased
estimation of variances.  The practical difficulty with the simple replicated
approach to design and variance estimation is that many replicates are needed
to achieve stability of the variance estimator.  Unfortunately, a  design with
many independent replicates must utilize a coarser stratification than
alternative designs--to achieve stable variance estimates, sample precision
must be sacrificed. Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), Jackknife Repeated
Replication (JRR) and the Bootstrap are alternative replication techniques
that may be used for estimating sampling errors for statistics based on
complex sample data.

      The BRR method is applicable to stratified designs in which two
half-sample units (i.e., PSUs) are selected from each design stratum.  The
conventional "two PSU-per-stratum" design in the best theoretical example of
such a design although in practice, collapsing of strata (Kalton, 1977) and
random combination of units within strata are employed to restructure a sample
design  for BRR variance estimation. The half-sample codes prepared for the
1994 NES data set require the collapsing of nonself-representing strata and
the randomized combination of selection units within self-representing (SR)
strata.  When full balancing of the half-sample assignments is employed
(Wolter, 1985), BRR is the most computationally efficient  of the replicated
variance estimation techniques. The number of general purpose BRR sampling
error estimation programs in the public domain is limited. The OSIRIS REPERR
program includes the option for BRR estimation of sampling errors for least
squares  regression coefficients and correlation statistics.  Westat, Inc. has
developed the Westvar PC for BRR estimation of standard errors.  Another
option is to use SAS or SPSS Macro facilities to implement the relatively
simple BRR algorithm.  The necessary computation formulas and Hadamard
matrices to define the half-sample replicates are available in Wolter (1985).

     With improvements in computational flexibility and speed, jackknife (JRR)
and bootstrap methods for sampling error estimation and inference have become
more common (Rao and Wu, 1988 ).  Few general purpose programs for jackknife
estimation of variances are available to analysts.  OSIRIS REPERR has a JRR
module for estimation of standard errors for regression and correlation
statistics.  Other stand alone programs may also be available in the general
survey research community.  Like BRR, the algorithm for JRR is relatively easy
to program using SAS, SPSS or S-Plus macro facilities.

     BRR and JRR are variance estimation techniques, each designed  to
minimize the number of "resamplings" needed to compute the variance estimate.
In theory, the bootstrap is not simply a tool for variance estimation but an
approach to actual inference for statistics.  In practice, the bootstrap is
implemented by resampling (with replacement) from the observed sample units.
To ensure that the full complexity of the design is reflected , the selection
of each bootstrap reflects the full complexity of the stratification,
clustering and weighting that is present in the original sample design.  A
large number of bootstrap samples are selected and the statistic of interest
is computed for each.  The empirical distribution of the estimate that results
from the large set of bootstrap samples can then be used to a variance
estimate and a support interval for inference about the population statistic
of interest.

     In most practical survey analysis problems, the JRR and Bootstrap methods
should yield similar results.  Most survey analysts should choose JRR due to
its computational efficiency.  NES data analysts interested in the bootstrap
technique are referred to LePage and Billard (1992) for additional reading and
a bibliography for the general literature on this topic.

     One aspect of BRR, JRR and bootstrap variance estimation that is often
pushed aside in practice is the treatment of analysis weights.  In theory,
when a resampling occurs (i.e., a BRR half sample is formed), the analysis
weights should be recomputed based only on the selection probabilities,
nonresponse characteristics and post-stratification outcomes for the units
included in the resample.  This is the correct way of performing resampling
variance estimation; however, in practice acceptable estimates can be obtained
through use of the weights as they are provided on the public use data set.

          Sampling Error Computation Models

     Regardless of whether  linearization or a resampling approach is used,
estimation of variances for complex sample survey estimates requires the
specification of a sampling error computation model.  NES data analysts who
are interested in performing sampling error computations should be aware that
the estimation programs identified in the preceding section assume a specific
sampling error computation model and will require special sampling error
codes. Individual records in the analysis data set must be assigned sampling
error codes which identify to the programs the complex structure of the sample
(stratification, clustering) and are compatible with the computation
algorithms of the various programs.  To facilitate the computation of sampling
error for statistics based on 1996 NES data, design-specific sampling error
codes will be routinely included in all public-use versions of the data set.
Although minor recoding may be required to conform to the input requirements
of the individual programs, the sampling error codes that are provided should
enable analysts to conduct either Taylor Series or Replicated estimation of
sampling errors for survey statistics.

     Table 10 defines the sampling error coding system for 1996 NES sample
cases.  Two sampling error code variables are defined for each case based on
the sample design primary stage unit (PSU) and area segment in which the
sample household is located.

     Sampling Error Stratum Code (Variable #2125).  The Sampling Error
Computation Stratum Code is the variable which defines the sampling error
computation strata for all sampling error analysis of the NES data.  With the
exception of the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago MSAs, each
self-representing (SR) design stratum is represented by one sampling error
computation stratum.  Due to their population size, two sampling error
computation strata are defined for each of the three largest MSAs.  Pairs of
similar nonself-representing (NSR) primary stage design strata are "collapsed"
(Kalton, 1977) to create NSR sampling error computation strata.

     For both the 1980 and 1990 SRC National Sample design controlled
selection and a "one-per-stratum" PSU allocation are used to select the
primary stage of the 1996 NES  national sample.  The purpose in using
controlled selection and the "one-per-stratum" sample allocation is to reduce
the between-PSU component of sampling variation relative to a"two-per-stratum"
primary stage design.  Despite the expected improvement in sample precision, a
drawback of the "one-per-stratum" design is that two or more sample selection
strata must be collapsed or combined to form a sampling error computation
stratum.  Variances are then estimated under the assumption that a multiple
PSU per stratum design was actually used for primary stage selection.  The
expected consequence of collapsing design strata into sampling error
computation strata is the overestimation of the true sampling error; that is,
the sampling error computation model defined by the codes contained in Table
14 will yield estimates of sampling errors which in expectation will be
slightly greater than the true sampling error of the statistic of interest.

     SECU - Stratum-specific Sampling Error Computation Unit code (Variable
#2126) is a half sample code for analysis of sampling error using the BRR
method or approximate "two-per-stratum" Taylor Series method (Kish and Hess,
1959).  Within the SR sampling error strata, the SECU half sample units are
created by dividing sample cases into random halves, SECU=1 and SECU=2. The
assignment of cases to half-samples is designed to preserve the stratification
and second stage clustering properties of the sample within an SR stratum.
Sample cases are assigned to SECU half samples based on the area segment in
which they were selected.  For this assignment, sample cases were placed in
original stratification order (area segment number order) and beginning with a
random start entire area segment clusters were systematically assigned to
either SECU=1 or SECU=2.

     In the general case of nonself-representing (NSR) strata, the half sample
units are defined according to the PSU to which the respondent was assigned at
sample selection.  That is, the half samples for each NSR sampling error
computation stratum bear a one-to-one correspondence to the sample design NSR
PSUs.  The particular sample coding provided on the NES public use data set is
consistent with the "ultimate cluster" approach to complex sample variance
estimation (Kish, 1965; Kalton, 1977).  Individual stratum, PSU and segment
code variables may be needed by NES analysts interested in components of
variance analysis or estimation of hierarchical models in which PSU-level and
neighborhood-level effects are explicitly estimated.

     Table 10 shows the sampling error stratum and SECU codes to be used for
the paired selection model for sampling error computations for any 1996 NES
analyses; the same codes can be used when using the 1996 NES combined
Cross-section/Panel data or when using 1996 NES Panel data separately.  The
first 42 strata reflect the two-thirds 1980 National Sample design used in
1994 and apply to the 1996 NES Panel.  Strata 51 through 89 reflect the half
sample 1990 National Sample design used for the 1996 NES Cross-section
supplement.

      It can be seen from this table that the three-digit 1996 SE code is
comprised of:  first, the two-digit SE Stratum code followed by the one-digit
SECU code.

Generalized Sampling Error Results for the 1996 NES

     To assist NES analysts, the PC SUDAAN program was used to compute
sampling errors for a wide-ranging example set of proportions estimated from
the 1996 NES Pre-election Survey data set.  For each estimate, sampling errors
were computed for the total sample and for twenty demographic and political
affiliation subclasses of the 1996 NES Pre-election Survey sample.  The
results of these sampling error computations were then summarized and
translated into the general usage sampling error table provided in Table 11.
The mean value of deft, the square root of the design effect, was found to be
1.346.  The design effect was primarily due to weighting effects (Kish, 1965)
and did not vary significantly by subclass size.  Therefore the generalized
variance table is produced by multiplying the simple random sampling standard
error for each proportion and sample size by the average deft for the set of
sampling error computations.

     Incorporating the pattern of "design effects" observed in the extensive
set of example computations, Table 11 provides approximate standard errors for
percentage estimates based on the 1996 NES.  To use the table, examine the
column heading to find the percentage value which best approximates the value
of the estimated percentage that is of interest.[25]  Next, locate the
approximate sample size base (denominator for the proportion) in the left-hand
row margin of the table.  To find the approximate standard error of a
percentage estimate, simply cross-reference the appropriate column
(percentage) and row (sample size base).  Note: the tabulated values represent
approximately one standard error for the percentage estimate.  To construct an
approximate confidence interval, the analyst should apply the appropriate
critical point from the "z" distribution (e.g., z=1.96 for a two-sided 95%
confidence interval half-width).  Furthermore, the approximate standard errors
in the table apply only to single point estimates of percentages not to the
difference between two percentage estimates.
----------
1 NECMAs are used in the 1996 NES Cross-section component only, which is drawn
  from the 1990 SRC National Sample.

2 The 730 listed housing units projected to be necessary to produce the 430
  interviews from the 1996 NES Cross-section supplement were increased by 10%
  (73) for reserve releases.  The 803 listed housing units selected for this
  component of the 1996 NES Sample actually yielded 666 eligible households
  within which an interview was attempted.

3 Further description of the 1994 sample design can be found in  "Sample
  Design: Technical Memoranda,  1994 Election Study" pp. 882-905 in Steven J.
  Rosenstone, Donald R. Kinder, Warren E. Miller and the National Election
  Studies.  AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1994: POST-ELECTION SURVEY.

4 The 1994 NES Panel consisted of all 1005 Respondents from the 1992 NES
  Cross-section sample.  Of these, 925 were recontacted in the 1993 NES Pilot
  Study (a follow-up of the 1992 NES survey), of which 750 were
  re-interviewed, 98 refused to be re-interviewed and 77 could not be
  re-interviewed at that time due to some 'permanent' condition. 80 of the
  1005 1992 NES Cross-section respondents could not be found for re-interview
  in 1993.

5 Analysis of pooled data from respondents from both components of the 1994
  NES sample requires a strong assumption about the nature of the attrition of
  the 1992 NES Cross-section sample.  It must be assumed that Panel attrition
  is not correlated with variables under consideration in the analysis.

6 Non-MSA segments were selected from the 1980 Census summary tape file series
  STF1B file, with minimum SSU size of 50 occupied HUs.

7 The number of segments shown for the 1996 NES Panel is the expected count;
  it is based on the number of 1994 NES Cross-section and Panel segments
  having selected lines.  It is possible that some of these segments yielded
  no 1994 interviews and so do not actually show up in the 1996 Panel.

10  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) June 1990 definitions of MSAs,
    NECMAs, county, parish, independent city.  These, of course, differ
    in some respects from the primary stage unit (PSU) definitions used
    in the 1980 SRC National Sample so will not be strictly comparable to
    the 1996 NES Panel PSUs--particularly in New England where MSAs were
    used as PSUs in the 1980 National Sample and NECMAs were used as PSUs
    in the 1990 National Sample.

11  For more detailed description of original Panel component selection,
    see pages 3-7 of this documentation.

12 In the 1990 SRC National Sample, U.S. Census Region boundaries were
   maintained for purposes of stratification at the Primary Stage of
   selection. Since some MSA definitions cross Region boundaries, such MSAs
   were split and the MSA counties recombined in ways that maintained the
   Region boundary.
   This PSU actually contains the Ohio counties from both the Steubenville-
   Wierton, OH-WV MSA (Jefferson County, OH) and the Wheeling, WV-OH MSA
   (Belmont County, OH) and although it is made up of MSA counties--it is not
   a cohesive MSA by OMB 1990 definition.

13 For efficiency of field work the substitution of two "B1" PSUs was allowed
   for the "A" areas in the normal 1990 half-sample -- Waco, TX MSA for
   Oklahoma City, OK MSA and Jim Wells County, TX for Lavaca County, TX.

   weighted proportionately as described above for 1996 NES combined
   Cross-section and panel analysis.

22 This 1996 Panel response rate appears lower than the 0.76 reported on Table
   4 which was computed based on recontacted households having the eligible R
   from the 1994 study and  actual 1996 NES sample release and interview
figures
   from the 1996  NES final field report.

23 The four San Francisco (separated from Oakland, CA in the 1990 OMB
   definition), CA MSA area segments were considered as part of the
   Los Angeles-Long Beach, CA MSA for purposes of SE Code assignment
   to avoid having empty SE CODE cells since there were very few 1996
   NES Cross-section respondents in this MSA.

25 The standard error of a percentage is a symmetric function with its maximum
   centered at p=50%; i.e., the standard error of p=40% and p=60% estimates
   are equal.

     The generalized variance results presented in Table 11 are a useful tool
for initial, cursory examination of the NES survey results.  For more in depth
analysis and reporting of critical estimates, analysts are encouraged to
compute exact estimates of standard errors using the appropriate choice of a
sampling error program and computation model.

>> 1996 CONTEXTUL DATA NOTE ON ESTIMATION OF MEDIA MARKET VARIABLES

     Media market variables, indicators of the cost of
advertising within geographic regions of the United States, are
available for Designated Market Areas (DMAs).  These DMAs are
identified by a geographic market design that is based on
measured viewing patterns.  The design is comprised of
approximately 200 mutually exclusive television markets, or DMAs. 
Every county in the United States is assigned exclusively to one
DMA.
     Since each county falls within only one DMA, estimating
media market variables for counties is relatively
straightforward.  Each county is assigned the media market
measures for the DMA in which the county falls.  The measures
included as part of the National Election Study 1996 Contextual
Data File are:  number of DMA households, average cost per point
across all time slots, cost per point for Early News, cost per
point for Prime Access, cost per point for Prime Time, and cost
per point for Late News.
     Since congressional districts may encompass several
different counties and DMAs, precise media market measures for
congressional districts are unavailable.  The district-level
measures included in the Contextual Data File are estimates based
on county populations expressed as proportions of the total
populations of House districts.  Specifically, the county-level
DMA measures were multiplied by the following proportion:  the
county population falling into a House district, divided by the
total population of the House district.  These "weighted" DMA
measures were then summed within each House district.
     Consider, for example, a hypothetical congressional district
that includes two counties.  The population of County A makes up
20 percent of the House district, while the population of County
B comprises 80 percent of the House district.  The DMA media
market measures for County A and County B would be multiplied by
.20 and .80, respectively, and then summed to provide estimated
DMA media market measures for the House district.
     The county population falling into each congressional
district was taken from Congressional Quarterly's (1993)
Congressional Districts in the 1990s.  The DMA media market
measures are based on Nielsen's 211 DMA markets for 1996 and were
taken from the Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook 1996.

of Overseers approved a different means of asking about recall of political
advertisements in the 1996 NES.  Two important differences set 1996 apart from
1992.  One is that the question in 1996 asks the respondent to focus on recall
of a single specific ad,  the one you ad remember best'.  In 1992 the question
asked about "what do you remember about any of these ads"-- in the plural.
Second, in 1992 the question concerned Presidential ads while in 1996 the
questions did not restrict respondents to Presidential ads,.  Thus the coding
scheme for 1996, while developed from and similar to that of 1992, is not the
same.  Differing coding categories exist (specific ads mentioned in 1992 of
course have no relevance in 1996) and the frequencies for similar or repeated
categories are also different.  The effort in 1996 was to code accurately the
open-ended responses received in 1996 while producing codes that could be
aggregated in ways that facilitate some kinds of comparisons between 1992 and
1996.

R Pays No Attention To Political Ads

001    R claims not to remember what the ads s/he saw were about - NFS (R says
only "nothing", "very little/not much", "can't remember", "don't recall", etc.
without further explanation or elaboration).

002    R deliberately and actively avoids watching political ads (I hit the
mute button/change the channel; I go to the refrigerator, etc.)

003    R does watch the political ads but indicates s/he chooses to pay no
attention to them (I don't pay much attention, they don't register on my mind,
goes in one ear and out the other, I just laugh at them, I'm immune to them).

>> 1980 CENSUS OCCUPATION CODE

The full 3-digit 1980 Census Occupation Code was used to
code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
the amount of highly specific information released about
respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
sub-headings in the Census Code.

Users who need access to the full 3-digit occupation code
for their research purposes should contact NES project staff
for details about how this could be arranged.

In the code description that follows, the full 1980 Census
Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
(ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
occupations have been recoded.  For example, purchasing
managers (009), legislators (003), and funeral directors
(018) have all been recoded to (01).  Numbers in parentheses
following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
"N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

>> 1990 CENSUS DEFINITIONS

          THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS
          USED BY THE 1990 U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION:

               Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Urbanized Areas
               Places
               Incorporated Places
               Unincorporated Places

          1. "METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSA's):"

          The general concept of a metropolitan area is one of a large
          population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that
          have a high degree of economic and social integration with
          that nucleus.

          In 1990 the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
          the U.S. Census have used the term Metropolitan Statistical
          Area (MSA) for what in 1980 was referred to as Standard
          Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).  An attempt has been
          made by the study staff to be consistent in using the newer
          terms in the current documentation and definitions.  The
          definitions of characteristics to be classified as a
          metropolitan area have remained fairly consistent--with only
          minor changes between 1980 and 1990.  However, due to
          changes in population size and density, employment,
          commuting and other behavior which defines metropolitan
          areas, the specific geographical composition of any given
          metropolitan area has, of course, frequently changed.  The
          specific MSA title may also have changed as to which cities
          are named and in what order.

          Each MSA has one or more central counties containing the
          area's main population concentration: an urganized area with
          at least 50,000 inhabitants.  An MSA may also include
          outlying counties that have close economic and social
          relationships with the central counties.  The outlying
          counties must have a specified level of commuting to the
          central counties and must also meet certain standards
          regarding metropolitan character, such as population
          density, urban population and population growth.  In New
          England, MSA's are composed of cities and towns rather than
          whole counties.

          The population living in MSA's may also be referred to as
          the metropolitan population.  The population is subdivided
          into "inside central city (or cities)" and "outside central
          city (or cities)."  (The population living outside MSA's
          constitutes the non-metropolitan population.)  Most MSA's
          have one to three CENTRAL CITIES that are named in the
          census title of the MSA.

          2. "CONSOLIDATED METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (CMSA's):"

          In some parts of the country, metropolitan development has
          progressed to the point that adjoining MSA's are themselves
          socially and economically interrelated.  These areas are
          designated consolidated metropolitan statistical areas
          (CMSA's) by the Office of Management and Budget, and are
          defined using standards included as part of the new MSA
          standards described above.  MSA's that are a part of a CMSA
          are referred to as primary metropolitan statistical areas
          (PMSA's).

          For the purpose of size and distance coding of suburbs and
          non-MSAs, the central cities of the six largest CMSAs are
          listed as:

               1.  New York City (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
                   Queens), NY, Elizabeth, NJ and Newark, NJ

          (PB90-214420)

          3. "URBANIZED AREAS:"

          The major objective of the Census Bureau in delineating
          urbanized areas is to provide a better separation of urban
          and rural population in the vicinity of large cities.  An
          urbanized area consists of a central city or cities, and
          surrounding closely settled territory ("urban fringe").

          4. "PLACES:"

          Two types of places are recognized in the census
          reports--incorporated places and unincorporated places,
          defined as follows:

          5. "INCORPORATED PLACES:"

          These are political units incorporated as cities, borought,

          6. "UNINCORPORATED PLACES:"

          The Census Bureau has delineated boundaries for closely
          settled population centers without corporate limits.  Each
          place so delineated possesses a definite nucleus of
          residences and has its boundaries drawn to include, if
          feasible, all the surrounding closely settled area.  These
          are called Census Designated Places (CDP's).

1.  Overview: Why is NES issuing new weight variables?

     A new set of weights has been constructed for use with the series of
National Election Studies beginning with the 1992 Pre-Election Study.  This
series includes the 1992 Pre and Post, the 1994 Post, and the 1996 Pre and
Post Election Studies. The main difference between these and the previously
released weights is found in the post-stratification criteria.  The new
weights post-stratify the National Election Study data to match the Current
Population Study (CPS) estimate  of the distribution of age group by education
level.  The previous set of weights adjusted the NES sample to the CPS
distribution for Census Region, sex, and age group.  These new  weights
correct for an under-representation of  younger and less educated respondents
in each year's sample of respondents mainly due to attrition of these
categories of respondents in the panel component.

     The previous set of analysis weights developed for the 1996 NES public
use data sets led to overestimation of reported voter turnout in the 1996
presidential election.  A comparison between the 1992 and the 1996
presidential vote turnout estimates from the NES samples does not to reflect
the trend of declining participation that has been evident from external
sources, such as the Current Population Survey turnout estimates.  Several
sources of bias caused of this problem, leading to under-representation of
18-22 year olds in the 1996 NES sample, respondents with no high school
diploma, or both.

The significance of this under-representation becomes clear when the rates of
voting participation by age and education subgroups are examined.  The results
are summarized in Tables 1a and 1b, below.  Table 1a clearly demonstrates the
well-known strong relationship between education and voting: people with less
education are less likely to vote.  Table 1b shows that reported voter turnout
is higher among older people. Since the age and education groups with the
lowest voting rates are underrepresented, estimates of 1996 presidential
election participation are skewed in the direction of higher rates of turnout.

     The following three sections describe the three major factors
which contribute to the under-representation of specific age or
education groups.  These include "initial contact non-response bias,"
"coverage bias resulting from longitudinal sample design" and "education
related attrition bias."  Subsequent sections describe in detail the
procedures used in the construction of the new weights.

2.  Initial Contact Nonresponse Bias

     The first important source of age and education related bias is
nonresponse bias at the initial interview.  Initial contact nonresponse
bias occurs when people with a certain characteristic in common have a
significantly different response rate from the overall response rate.
For example, if women are found to have a much higher response rate than
the combined response rate for men and women, then there is an initial
contact nonresponse bias based on gender.

     If there were no nonresponse bias based on age or education we
would expect the NES cross-section samples to have age by education
distributions similar to that of the Current Population Survey (CPS)
population estimates.  There would be minor differences attributable to
sampling error, but we would not expect to find large or systematic
differences.   Table 2, which compares the weighted distributions of
education for the  1992, 1994 and 1996 NES cross-section samples to CPS
population estimates for the same years suggests that systematic
differences are present.

     The weight used in Table 2 is the calculated base weight.  This
weight is the product of  a person-level selection weight and a
household-level nonresponse adjustment factor.  Since the selection
probability of  an eligible adult is inversely proportional  to the
number of eligible adults in the household it is important to use the
selection weight based on the number of eligible adults in the household
when comparing NES person-level statistics to CPS person-level
distributions.  The base weight also adjusts for the difference in
response rates by region and by urbanicity. The construction of these
weight factors  is described in Sections 5 through 8.  This part of the
NES weight is essentially the same for the old and new weights.

     In Table 2, CPS estimates for 1992, 1994 and 1996 are included in
the shaded columns.   Comparisons of the weighted cross-section data
from 1992, 1994 and 1996 to the corresponding CPS estimates reveal clear
systematic differences which cannot be wholly attributed to sampling
error.   In all three cross-section groups there is a strong
relationship between the level of education achieved by the respondent
and the nonresponse rate.  Specifically, people with less education --
especially people without a high school diploma - tend to be
underrepresented in the weighted cross-section samples.

3. Coverage Bias Resulting from Longitudinal Sample Design

     The longitudinal design of the National Election Study results in
a coverage bias in the 1992 and 1994 cross-section component of the 1996
sample.   Respondents age 18-19 had no chance of being observed in the
panel.  Respondents age 20 or 21 years old had a chance of inclusion in
only the 1994 cross-section component of the 1996 panel.  This
structural bias in cross-sectional estimates based on the combined 1996
NES sample is an additional contributor to under-representation of the
younger population.  The age 18-21 bias in the sample also affects
education since  the youngest group (e.g., 18-22) has a natural
constraint on the level of education that a respondent could have
achieved by the time he or she was interviewed.

4.  Education Related Attrition Bias

     Differential reinterview rates (pre to post as well as across
election year waves)  based on education also contribute to over-
estimation of voting in the 1996 presidential election. The relationship
between education and cumulative attrition is shown in Tables 3a-3c.

     Table 3a tracks the 1992 cross-section cases across subsequent
interviews.  The age groups listed in the left-most column  refer to the
respondent's age at the initial interview.  Thus, a 29 year old
respondent in 1992 would not move into the next higher age group in
1994.   Columns labeled "%" indicate the percent of the original sample
that was reinterviewed.   For example, in Table 3a, under 1996  (pre),
there is a column labeled  "n" and a column labeled "%".   The value in
the top row in the "%" column is 71.4%.  This means that 71.4 percent of
the seven  18-21 year olds with no HS diploma were included in the panel
component of the 1996 pre election interview.   Sample Tables 3b and 3c
show the attrition for the 1994 and 1996 cross-section components.

     The summaries of cumulative attrition by education group portray a
strong relationship between education and reinterview rate.  Respondents
with more education are more likely to participate in subsequent
interviews.   This difference in attrition rate is found between pre and
post interviews of the same year (Table 3a - 1992 Post, Table 3c - 1996
Post) as well as across interview years (Table 3b - 1996 Pre).
Initially biased samples are subjected to further nonresponse bias at
every subsequent interview, causing significant under-representation of
less educated, eligible voters.  Since eligible adults with low
education are less likely to vote and are under-represented in the
sample, predictions of voting participation will be biased upward.

5. Construction of the new weights

     The revised NES final analysis weight is based on the product of a
calculated base weight and a post-stratification factor.  The base
weight is constructed to adjust for selection probability and geographic
differences in response rates at the time of the initial interview with
each sample component.  This weight is the product of a selection
probability  weight and the household nonresponse factor. The base
weights for 1992, 1994, and 1996 cross-section cases are initially
determined using the corresponding year's household nonresponse factor.
Panel cases use this same base weight, carried over from the original
interview.   Since differences in selection probabilities for the NES
sample household are due only to random selection of a single adult from
households of various sizes, the selection probability weight is the
number of eligible people in the household (up to three).

     The post-stratification factor is the ratio of the census
proportion for each age by education subgroup, to the corresponding
weighted ( base weight ) sample proportion.  Multiplication of the base
weight by this post-stratification factor adjusts the weighted sample
distribution to conform to the CPS population estimates.  The following
sections describe the base weight and post-stratification factors in
further detail.

Final Weight = base weight x post-stratification factor

where:
     Base weight = selection weight x household nonresponse factor

and:
     Selection weight =  the number of eligible adults in household (up
to three)

6. Construction of a Base Weight

     The base weight is the product of two factors: the selection
weight and the household nonresponse adjustment factor.  Although the
National Election Study uses an area probability sample design to
achieve an equal probability sample of U.S. households, the NES design
does not produce an equal probability sample of persons. Since only one
person is chosen from each selected household, any particular
individual's probability of selection is inversely proportional to the
number of eligible adults in the household.  The selection weight which
is equal to the number of eligible persons in the household (inverse of
the selection probability) adjusts for the under-representation of
persons in larger households.  The household nonresponse factor is used
to adjust for the differential nonresponse rates found in different
regions and PSU types (Self-representing MSA, Nonself-representing MSA,
and non-MSA.  Self-representing MSAs are the largest Metropolitan
Statistical Areas in the nation and are therefore self-representing in
the 1990 SRC National Sample; Nonself-representing MSAs are medium and
smaller sized MSAs, and the non-MSAs are counties which are not
designated as MSAs and are less urban.

7.  Selection Probability Weight:

     The National Election Study uses an area probability sample design
to achieve an equal  probability sample of U.S. households.    If a
household has only one eligible adult, that person is included in the
sample.   If a selected household has more than one eligible adult, one
is selected at random.   Since the number of eligible adults varies
across households, the probability of selection for individuals is
unequal and a weight which is the reciprocal of the probability of
selection should be used.  In the interest of  limiting the variation of
the weights, respondents selected from households with more than three
eligible adults were assigned a weight of three; otherwise the selection
weight is equal to the number of eligible adults.

8. Household  Nonresponse Adjustment Factor:

     Nonresponse bias is a potential source of nonsampling error in the
NES data.  It has been found that response rates vary significantly by
geographic region and PSU type (MSA/non-MSA status).    In an effort to
counteract this potential source of bias, adjustment factors have been
constructed at the household level to account for the geographic and
urban/rural differences in response rates.   Table 4 shows the initial
contact response rates in the 1992, 1994 and 1996 NES by PSU type and
region.

     The nonresponse adjustment factor was determined by  dividing the
cross-section cases among twelve cells of four regions (Northeast /
Midwest / South /West) by three PSU types (SR MSA, NSR MSA, NSR Non-
MSA).  The cases in  each cell share a  nonresponse adjustment factor
calculated as the inverse of the response rate of the cell.  These
response rates are for the initial cross-section components only.  They
do not include the panel cases.

9.  Comparison of Weighted NES and CPS Age Group by Education Level
Distributions

     Table 5a below shows the current interview age by education
distributions of 1992 cross-section cases in initial and subsequent
interviews.   The table includes weighted (base weight) percentages and
unweighted percentages with estimates of the population percentages according
to the Current Population Study included for comparison.  We can see for
example, that in the 1992 NES pre election sample there were 15 respondents
age 22-29 with no high school diploma.  These represent approximately 1.3
percent of the 1126 total respondents in this sample.  When the base weight is
used, the weighted percent for this group increases to about 1.6 percent.  The
1992 CPS population estimates are listed in a column on the left.  It is
estimated that in 1992 about 2.4 percent of all eligible adults were 22-29
year-olds with no high school diploma.  The shaded rows indicate totals by age
group and a summary by education is provided at the bottom of the page.  Table
5b gives the same information for the 1994 cross-section cases and Table 5c
shows  the 1996 cross-section distributions.

9.  Post-stratification Factor for the Revised Weights:

     The post-stratification factor for the revised NES cross-sectional
weights was developed to address problems caused by under-representation
of age or education groups.     To do this, the corresponding CPS
estimates were used as the benchmark  standard. The post-stratification
factor was calculated by dividing the CPS percent by the weighted (base
weight) NES percent for each of the age by education subgroups. Note
that the youngest age group consists of only two education groups (no
college / at least some college) because  of the small number of 18 to
21 year olds in the samples (especially in 1994 and 1996) and because
level of education is not as meaningful for the youngest age group since
they may still be in school.

      Tables 6a, 6b and 6c show the data used to construct the post-
stratification factors  for the combined panel and cross-section NES
samples for each year.  As an example of the calculation, in the 1994
NES sample (Table 6b) there were fifty 18-21 year olds with no college
education.  These people represent approximately 2.8 percent
(unweighted) of the 1994 sample.  When the base weight is applied, the
weighted percent is about 3.5.  On the left side of each table the CPS
statistics for the corresponding year are listed.  These are used as
estimates of the population percentages by age and education.  The post-
stratification factor is calculated for each  subgroup by dividing the
CPS estimate by the weighted percent.  In the 1994 example this is 4.2
divided by approximately 3.5.  Although the percentages in the tables
are shown to the nearest tenth of a percent, the calculation of the
post-stratification factors used percents to the nearest hundredth of a
percent.

10. "Trimming  of weights

     The new weights for each sample -- 1992 pre and post, 1994 post
and 1996 pre and post - were calculated as the product of the
corresponding base weight and the post-stratification factor.   The
resulting products were then "trimmed" at the 1st and 99th percentiles in
order to control the potential for high variation caused by these
weights. The results of trimming at the 1st and 99th percentiles are
shown in Table 7.  The column labels "Before" and "After" indicate
whether the statistics refer to the weight before or after trimming.

11.  Results:

     The steps taken to address the 1996 NES overestimation of voting
in the 1996 presidential election resulted in the development of post-
stratified weights which account for individual selection probability,
geographic related household nonresponse, and misrepresentation of any
age by education subgroups.  These revised, CPS-standardized weights
were computed for the 1992 NES Pre and Post, 1994 NES Post and 1996 NES
Pre and Post Election data sets.  Users of previous weights released
with the 1992, 1994 and 1996 data will find that these weights extend
and combine the features of previously released weights.

     Table 8 compares the weighted ( final weights ) distributions by
age and education to the CPS estimates.  It is evident that the use of
the final weights results in a distribution which is more similar to CPS
population estimates.

     The final check on the revised weight is to use  this trimmed
final weight to estimate presidential election voting rates in 1992 and
1996.  Table 9 shows  that in both 1992 and 1996 the use of the final
weight results in significantly lower estimates of voting.
