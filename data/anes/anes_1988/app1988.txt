>> 1980 CENSUS DEFINITIONS

                THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED BY THE 1980
                U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION.

                      STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (SMSA'S):

                THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF A METROPOLITAN AREA IS ONE OF A LARGE
                POPULATION NUCLEUS, TOGETHER WITH ADJACENT COMMUNITIES THAT
                HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION WITH
                THAT NUCLEUS.

                EACH SMSA HAS ONE OR MORE CENTRAL COUNTIES CONTAINING THE
                AREA'S MAIN POPULATION CONCENTRATION: AN URBANIZED AREA WITH
                AT LEAST 50,000 INHABITANTS.  AN SMSA MAY ALSO INCLUDE
                OUTLYING COUNTIES THAT HAVE CLOSE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
                RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CENTRAL COUNTIES.  THE OUTLYING
                COUNTIES MUST HAVE A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMMUTING TO THE
                CENTRAL COUNTIES AND MUST ALSO MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS
                REGARDING METROPOLITAN CHARACTER, SUCH AS POPULATION
                DENSITY, URBAN POPULATION AND POPULATION GROWTH.  IN NEW
                ENGLAND, SMSA'S ARE COMPOSED OF CITIES AND TOWNS RATHER THAN
                WHOLE COUNTIES.

                THE POPULATION LIVING IN SMSA'S MAY ALSO BE REFERRED TO AS
                THE METROPOLITAN POPULATION.  THE POPULATION IS SUBDIVIDED
                INTO "INSIDE CENTRAL CITY (OR CITIES)" AND "OUTSIDE CENTRAL
                CITY (OR CITIES)."  (THE POPULATION LIVING OUTSIDE SMSA'S
                CONSTITUTES THE NON-METROPOLITAN POPULATION.)  MOST SMSA'S
                HAVE ONE TO THREE CENTRAL CITIES THAT ARE NAMED IN THE
                CENSUS TITLE OF THE SMSA.

                      STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS (SCSA'S):

                IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT HAS
                PROGRESSED TO THE POINT THAT ADJOINING SMSA'S ARE THEMSELVES
                SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY INTERRELATED.  THESE AREAS ARE
                DESIGNATED STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS (SCSA'S)
                BY THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET, AND ARE DEFINED
                USING STANDARDS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE NEW SMSA STANDARDS
                DESCRIBED ABOVE.

                            DEFINITIONS OF THE SIX LARGEST SCSA'S:

                 NEW YORK-NEWARK-JERSEY CITY, NY-NJ-CT, SCSA

                (SOURCE:  TABLE 2 OF 1980 CENSUS OF POPULATION PC80-S1-5,
                STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND STANDARD
                CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS:  1980.)

                FOR THE PURPOSE OF SIZE AND DISTANCE CODING OF SUBURBS AND
                NON-SMSA'S, THE CENTRAL CITIES OF THE FIVE LARGEST SCSA'S
                ARE LISTED AS: NEW YORK (MANHATTAN), LOS ANGELES, CHICAGO,
                PHILADELPHIA, SAN FRANCISCO, AND DETROIT.

                URBANIZED AREAS: THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE CENSUS BUREAU IN
                DELINEATING URBANIZED AREAS IS TO PROVIDE A BETTER
                SEPARATION OF URBAN AND RURAL POPULATION IN THE VICINITY OF
                LARGE CITIES.  AN URBANIZED AREA CONSISTS OF A CENTRAL CITY
                OR CITIES, AND SURROUNDING CLOSELY SETTLED TERRITORY ("URBAN
                FRINGE").

                PLACES (IN THESE MATERIALS CALLED CENSUS PLACES):  TWO TYPES
                OF PLACES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CENSUS REPORTS--
                INCORPORATED PLACES AND UNINCORPORATED PLACES, DEFINED AS


                FOLLOWS:

                INCORPORATED PLACES--THESE ARE POLITICAL UNITS INCORPORATED
                AS CITIES, BOROUGHS, TOWNS AND VILLAGES WITH THE FOLLOWING
                EXCEPTIONS: (A) BOROUGHS IN ALASKA; AND (B) TOWNS IN NEW
                YORK, WISCONSIN AND THE NEW ENGLAND STATES.

                UNINCORPORATED PLACES--THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS DELINEATED
                BOUNDARIES FOR CLOSELY SETTLED POPULATION CENTERS WITHOUT
                CORPORATE LIMITS.  EACH PLACE SO DELINEATED POSSESSES A
                DEFINITE NUCLEUS OF RESIDENCES AND HAS ITS BOUNDARIES DRAWN
                TO INCLUDE, IF FEASIBLE, ALL THE SURROUNDING CLOSELY SETTLED
                AREA.







>> 1988 PARTY/CANDIDATE MASTER CODE

                THIS NOTE IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH VARIABLES THAT RECORD
                WHAT THE RESPONDENT LIKES AND DISLIKES ABOUT THE POLITICAL
                PARTIES AND A NUMBER OF PROMINENT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES.
                THE CODES HAVE BEEN REVISED FROM THE 1986 ELECTION STUDY.

                ANY CATEGORY IN THE ENTIRE MASTER-CODE SET CAN BE A REASON
                FOR LIKING OR DISLIKING SOMEONE, AND MOST CATEGORIES CAN
                REFER AS WELL TO PARTIES AND CANDIDATES.  FOR EXAMPLE, "VERY
                LIBERAL IDEAS" CAN LOGICALLY BE A REASON FOR LIKING OR
                DISLIKING EITHER PARTY OR EITHER CANDIDATE.  WHICH OF THE
                EIGHT LIKE/DISLIKE-PARTY/CANDIDATE FIELDS A RESPONSE FALLS
                INTO CAN BE DETERMINED NORMALLY BY THE QUESTION IT REFERS
                TO.

                THE REASONS ARE BROKEN UP INTO SERIES OF HUNDREDS, ACCORDING
                TO THE CONTENT AREA OF THE RESPONSE:

                                                     MISCELLANEOUS

                     99 HUNDRED SERIES---------------MISSING DATA CODES

                A RESPONSE WAS NOT CODED AS REFERRING TO A PARTY OR
                CANDIDATE UNLESS THE PARTY OR CANDIDATE WAS ACTUALLY
                MENTIONED.  THAT IS, IF THE RESPONDENT LIKED THE REPUBLICANS
                BECAUSE THEY ARE FIRM ON COMMUNISM, THIS RESPONSE WAS NOT
                ALSO CODED AS A DISLIKE OF DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOFT
                ON COMMUNISM, UNLESS THIS WAS ALSO CLEARLY STATED.  EVEN A
                COMPARATIVE REFERENCE SUCH AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE FIRMER ON
                COMMUNISM THAT THE DEMOCRATS, WAS CODED ONLY AS A
                PRO-REPUBLICAN RESPONSE.  IF R SAID "REPUBLICANS ARE FIRM ON
                COMMUNISM, DEMOCRATS ARE NOT," BOTH RESPONSES WERE CODED.

                FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ACCESS TO
                THESE DATA MAY BE PROVIDED.

                A DETAILED SERIES OF QUESTIONS RELATING TO OCCUPATION AND
                WORK WAS ASKED OF THE RESPONDENT (Q.Y4-Y20A).  IF THE
                RESPONDENT WAS FEMALE AND MARRIED/PARTNERED, A PARALLEL
                SERIES OF ITEMS WAS ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND/PARTNER'S
                OCCUPATION AND WORK (Q.Y22-Y37A).  IF THE RESPONDENT WAS
                MALE AND MARRIED/PARTNERED, ONLY ONE SUMMARY ITEM REGARDING
                HIS WIFE/PARTNER'S WORK STATUS WAS OBTAINED (Q.Y3H).  THIS
                DIFFERS FROM EARLIER STUDIES WHERE FULL SPOUSE/PARTNER
                INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES, AND
                1986, WHERE ONLY ONE ITEM ON SPOUSE/PARTNER WORK STATUS WAS
                ASKED.

                THERE ARE TWO RECODED SERIES OF VARIABLES CONCERNING
                OCCUPATION AND WORK-- THE ICPSR "STACKED" VARIABLES FOR
                RESPONDENT AND MARRIED/PARTNERED FEMALE RESPONDENT'S
                HUSBAND/PARTNER.  IN THE OCCUPATION SECTION, RESPONDENTS ARE
                FIRST ASKED A LEAD-IN QUESTION ABOUT THEIR CURRENT WORK
                STATUS (E.G., EMPLOYED, TEMPORARILY LAID OFF, UNEMPLOYED,
                RETIRED, PERMANENTLY DISABLED, HOMEMAKER, STUDENT). THEN,
                THE RESPONDENT IS ASKED OCCUPATION AND WORK QUESTIONS
                RELEVANT TO HIS/HER CURRENT WORK STATUS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF
                THE RESPONDENT WAS UNEMPLOYED, HE/SHE WOULD BE ASKED THE
                QUESTIONS FROM THE UNEMPLOYED/RETIRED/PERMANENTLY DISABLED
                SECTION CONCERNING THE RESPONDENT'S LAST REGULAR JOB.
                ALTHOUGH THE QUESTIONS DEPENDENT UPON WORK STATUS DIFFER
                SLIGHTLY, MOST OF THE ITEMS ASKED ARE PARALLEL, WITH
                SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WORDING TO REFLECT THE WORK-STATUS
                CATEGORY. IT HAS BEEN ICPSR PRACTICE TO "STACK" RESPONSES TO
                PARALLEL SERIES OF QUESTIONS INTO VARIABLES THAT INCLUDE
                INFORMATION ABOUT WORK AND OCCUPATION FOR ALL RESPONDENTS
                ACROSS ALL WORK STATUS CATEGORIES.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO
                THIS ARE THOSE RESPONDENTS WHO ARE HOMEMAKERS AND/OR
                STUDENTS WITHOUT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.  THESE CASES ARE CODED
                INAP THROUGHOUT THE STACKED VARIABLE SERIES.  THE OCCUPATION
                SERIES FOR "R'S HUSBAND/PARTNER" IS STACKED IN THE SAME
                FASHION. PLEASE REMEMBER, HOWEVER, THAT THIS SERIES WAS
                ASKED ONLY WHERE THE RESPONDENT WAS FEMALE AND
                MARRIED/PARTNERED.

                THE ICPSR RELEASE OF THE 1988 PRE/POST ELECTION FILE
                INCLUDES BOTH THE ORIGINAL OCCUPATION/WORK ITEMS AND THE
                STACKED VERSIONS OF THESE VARIABLES.  RESPONDENT UNSTACKED
                ITEMS CAN BE FOUND IN V430-V464.  STACKED RESPONDENT ITEMS
                ARE IN V465-474.  UNSTACKED "HUSBAND/PARTNER" ITEMS ARE IN
                V480-V506 AND STACKED "HUSBAND/PARTNER" ITEMS ARE IN
                V507-V516.  USERS SHOULD NOTE THE ABSENCE OF 11 ITEMS
                PERTAINING TO R'S HUSBAND/PARTNER AS "STUDENT OR HOMEMAKER:
                NOT CURRENTLY WORKING; HAS WORKED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS" IN
                THIS ICPSR RELEASE.  THESE VARIABLES WERE IN THE EARLY CPS
                RELEASE, BUT DO NOT APPEAR HERE BECAUSE THE ITEMS CONTAINED
                NO VALID CASES.

                FINALLY, IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS ELECTION STUDIES, THE 1988
                PRE/POST SURVEY DID NOT COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING "HEAD
                OF FAMILY".  THEREFORE, BOTH ORIGINAL AND RECODED VARIABLES
                RELATING TO THE OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION OF "HEAD OF FAMILY"
                THAT APPEARED IN EARLIER ELECTION STUDIES, DO NOT APPEAR IN
                THE 1988 FILE.



>> 1980 CENSUS OCCUPATION CODE

                CODING OF OCCUPATION IN THE 1988 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY

                THE FULL 3-DIGIT 1980 CENSUS BUREAU OCCUPATION CODE WAS USED
                TO CODE THE OCCUPATION OF RESPONDENTS.  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE
                THE AMOUNT OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELEASED ABOUT
                RESPONDENTS, THE FULL OCCUPATION CODE HAS BEEN RECODED TO A
                71 CATEGORY CODE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE OCCUPATION CODE
                SUB-HEADINGS IN THE CENSUS CODE.

                USERS WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE FULL 3-DIGIT OCCUPATION CODE
                FOR THEIR RESEARCH PURPOSES SHOULD CONTACT NES PROJECT STAFF
                FOR DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS COULD BE ARRANGED.

                IN THE CODE DESCRIPTION THAT FOLLOWS, THE FULL 1980 CENSUS
                CODE IS PRESENTED.  AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH RECODED
                SECTION, THE STATEMENT 'CENSUS CODES (XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE
                RECODED TO (ZZ)' APPEARS TO INDICATE THE CODE VALUES TO THAT
                THE SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS HAVE BEEN RECODED.  FOR EXAMPLE,
                PURCHASING MANAGERS (009), LEGISLATORS (003), AND FUNERAL
                DIRECTORS (018) HAVE ALL BEEN RECODED TO (01).  NUMBERS IN
                PARENTHESES FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION CATEGORIES ARE THE 1980
                STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION CODE EQUIVALENTS.  THE
                ABBREVIATION "PT" MEANS "PART" AND "N.E.C." MEANS "NOT
                ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED".

                THE 1971 QUALITY OF LIFE STUDY (468110).

                1 = CITY OF OVER 1,000,000
                2 = CITY OF OVER 25,000 AND UP TO 250,000 IN AN SMSA OF
                     1,000,000 OR MORE
                3 = CITY OF UNDER 25,000 IN AN SMSA OF 1,000,000 OR MORE
                4 = CITY OF OVER 250,000 AND UP TO 1,000,000
