Before an interview could be conducted, the screener was 
completed by an adult household member (called 'the 
informant'), who listed all adult (17 years old or older) 
household members. The informant also provided age, race,

to the informant for each listed member.
The random selection of Respondent was made among the 
screener's eligible household members (citizens age 18 or 
older by October 30, 2008).
Race categories in HHList.2 are the categories that were
available to the interviewer for coding the informant's 
description of each household member.
.....
Only when the informant is also the selected Respondent 
will HHList.2 represent a Respondent's self-identification 
of race.
Y24a-Y24e in the demographic section of the Pre-election 
interview asks the survey Respondent for his/her racial 
group(s) according to a different coding scheme.
For Respondents having black identification at either
HHList.2 [code 2] or Y24a-Y24e (demographic section racial 
group mentions), a summary comparison of screener race and 
demographic race is provided in Post-election item J9a.
Post-election item J9a codes Respondents who were flagged 
in the Post-election preload as black Respondents for
Post-election questions K1a-K1a1 (which were administered 
to black Respondents only).
.....
Respondent's race as identified in HHList.2 was used in
the construction of both pairs of post-stratified weights, 
WT.1 and WT.2 (centered at mean 1.0), and WT.1a and WT.2a 
(not centered).

description of each household member.
.....
Only when the informant is also the selected Respondent 
will HHList.3 represent a Respondent's self-identification 
of Latino status.
Respondents having Hispanic identification at either
HHList.3 [code 1] or in Pre demographic-section items 
Y24a-Y24e/Y27/Y28a were flagged in the Post preload (B2_)
as Hispanic Respondents for Post-election questions B2a- 
B2b, K1b-K1b1 (which were administered to Hispanic 
Respondents only).
Relevant Pre demographic items are:
Y24a-Y24e. R identifies his/her racial group(s) [coded] 
Y25.       R identifies his/her ethnicity [open]
Y27.       IWR checkpoint, any Hispanic ethnic mention
Y28a.      R answers whether he/she has Hispanic background;
           asked only if Y27 is coded No.
.....
Respondent's Latino status as identified in HHList.3 was

included in the screener, however among listed members 
who were 17 years old and citizens, only those who would 
become age-eligible (18 years old) by October 30, 2008 
were retained for the selection process.
For household members whose age was not known or was
refused by the informant in the screener, an age over 17 
years (as of October 30, 2008) was established prior to
inclusion in the selection process, even if exact age
was not ascertained as part of the screener.
.....
Only when the informant is also the selected Respondent 
will HHList.4 represent the Respondent's self-identification
of age.

NOTES:
-----
Built from all adult screener information.
Codes represent traditional ANES household composition 
categories and describe the adult composition of the 
household (including both eligible and noneligible 
adults). 
Married couple status in codes for HHList.10 also includes 
domestic partners, however, for continuity over the time-
series and due to the difficulty of consistently identifying 
same-sex relationships, married couple status in codes 
30-55 does not reflect same-sex partners.
Married couple codes were used whenever a married couple
was documented as present in the household.
.....
In 1 case (1483), an adult household member with 
relationship (to informant) refused was counted as a 
non-relative.

2. Reverse order response options for selected questions

REFERENCE:
---------
Appendix A1. (Pre-election questions with forward/reverse response options)
Appendix A2. (Post-election questions with forward/reverse response options)
Post: PostRandom.1. (Post response option order)

NOTES:
-----
For a selected set of Pre-electon survey questions, 
Respondents were randomly assigned to administration of 
all questions in the set using either forward or reverse 
order for the response options.
Appendix A1, "ANES 2008 Time Series Study Pre-election 
questions with forward/reverse response options" provides 
a list of all Pre-election questions included for the 
forward/reverse assignment.
If the Respondent was re-interviewed for the Post-election 
survey, the same (forward or reverse) response option order 
was assigned for a selection of Post-election questions.
Appendix A2, "ANES 2008 Time Series Study Post-election questions 
with forward/reverse response options" provides a list of 
all Post-election questions included in the set for forward/
reverse assignment.
.....
Reverse order meant that the order of response options 
in the question text was reversed, and the order in which 
response options were listed onscreen for interviewer coding 
was also reversed.

Split administration: "OLD" or "NEW" version

VALID CODES:
-----------

2. NEW version of selected questions

REFERENCE:
---------
Appendix B1.(Pre-election questions with split administration)
Appendix B2. (Post-election questions with split administration)
Post: PostRandom.2. (Post OLD/NEW split administration)

NOTES:
-----
The OLD/NEW split was the 'major' split for the ANES 2008 
Time Series Study.  
For the Pre-election interview, other splits were: A/B, C/D, 
E/F, G/H, J/K, M/N, P/Q, and R/S.  Appendix B1, "ANES 2008 
Time Series Study Pre-election questions with split 
administration," provides a list of all Pre-election questions 
having split administration.
If a Respondent was re-interviewed for the Post-election 
survey, OLD/NEW assignment carried over to a selection of 
Post-election questions.  For Post-election cases, item 
PostRandom.2 has the same value as PreRandom.2.
Appendix B2, "ANES 2008 Time Series Study Post-election 
questions with split administration," provides a list of 
all Post-election questions having split administration.
.....
For Pre-election issue questions traditionally administered 
as 7-point scales, with the exception of the aid to blacks 
(N5-N5c2) scale, Respondents were randomly assigned to either 
the standard 7-point scale ("OLD" version), or else were 
assigned to a "NEW" version of branching questions. 
For the women's role 7-point scale only, however, while the
OLD/NEW version assignment still applied, an alternative set of 
questions was not administered to the Respondents with NEW 
assignment in PreRandom.2; questions on the topic of women's 
role (P7-P7c2) represent only the half-sample of Respondents 
with OLD version assignment in PreRandom.2.
Assignment to OLD/NEW was the same for all sets of scale/ 
branching alternatives, with the exception of the aid to blacks 
7-point scale. All Pre-election Respondents were administered 
the standard 7-point scale on aid to blacks (N5-N5c2).
.....
Included for each scale/branching alternative was an
issue 'importance' question that was administered differently
according to the version assigned.  The OLD version of issue 
importance was the traditional ANES importance question but 
with response options in reverse order compared to the order 
used in most recent ANES Time Series studies; the NEW 
version of the issue importance question used a new set of
response options.
An exception to this pattern occurred for the aid to blacks 
7-point scale (which was administered to all Respondents), 
where OLD/NEW assignment in PreRandom.2 determined whether 
the OLD or NEW importance question (N5b1 or N5b2) was 
administered.
A similar exception also accompanied the question on gun 
control, which was not a 7-point scale but was followed by
split assignment to OLD/NEW 'importance' versions (P6a1 or 
P6a2) according to PreRandom.2.
.....
Additionally, OLD/NEW assignment applied to Pre-election 
media questions in section A.
Respondents who were assigned to OLD 7-point issue scales were
administered the standard media questions A11b-A11e1; Respondents 
assigned to NEW branching questions in place of traditional 
7-point issue scales were administered new media questions 
A12a-A12d1a.

Respondents were randomly assigned to the standard

campaign interest question A1b (VERSION B).
The A/B version assignment is specific to Pre-election 
campaign interest questions only (A1a/A1b) and is 
independent of the major "OLD/NEW" split documented in 
PreRandom.2.
Appendix B1, "ANES 2008 Time Series Study Pre-election

all Pre-election questions having split administration,
including all questions in the OLD/NEW split, and splits

PRE-ELECTION SURVEY

Please look at page 3 of the booklet. 
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political 
leaders and other people who are in the news these days. I'll 
read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that person 
using something we call the feeling thermometer. 
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel 
favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees 
and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the 
person and that you don't care too much for that person. You 
would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel 
particularly warm or cold toward the person. 
If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you don't 
need to rate that person. Just tell me and we'll move on to the 
next one.

PRE-ELECTION SURVEY

IF R SELECTED FOR HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS VERSION "OLD":

Please look at page 10 of the booklet. 
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and 
hospital costs.  Some people feel there should be a government 
insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital 
expenses for everyone. Suppose these people are at one end of 
a scale, at point 1. 
Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by 
individuals through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or 
other company paid plans. Suppose these people are at the other 
end, at point 7. 
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in 
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

       N5.  INTRO AID TO BLACKS
=============================================================================

PRE-ELECTION SURVEY

Please look at page 12 of the booklet. 
Some people feel that the government in Washington should 
make every effort to improve the social and economic position 
of blacks. (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, 
at point 1.) 
Others feel that the government should not make any special 
effort to help blacks because they should help themselves. 
(Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.) 
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in 
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

PRE-ELECTION SURVEY

IF R SELECTED FOR WOMEN'S ROLE QUESTIONS VERSION "OLD" (ONLY):

Please look at page 15 of the booklet. 
Recently there has been a lot of talk about women's rights. 
Some people feel that women should have an equal role with 
men in running business, industry, and government. (Suppose 
these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.) 
Others feel that a woman's place is in the home.  (Suppose 
these people are at the other end, at point 7.) 
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in 
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

For Respondent employment status summaries built from the 
entire Respondent employment/occupation module (Y7a-Y16k), 
see Y6x1 and Y6x2.
.....
The traditional set of 'stacked' occupation variables are
found in Y16x1-Y16xx11.
.....
Y6 represents the initial employment status given by the
Respondent to begin the employment-occupation series; it
precedes additional questions in the Respondent employment/ 
occupation module which may provide further information about 
the Respondent's complete employment status.
For Respondents with multiple mentions at the start of
the employment series:
5 and 1,2,4,6,7,8 = Y6 initial status Retired
4 and 6,7,8       = Y6 initial status Unemployed
                    (codes 1,2 not allowed with 4)
6 and 1,2,7,8     = Y6 initial status Disabled
7 and 1,2,8       = Y6 initial status Homemaker
8 and 1,2         = Y6 initial status Student
Codes 1 and 2 were not allowed to be coded in combination.
.....
Respondents with Y6 initial employment status 1 or 2
(Working Now or Temporarily Laid Off) proceed directly to 
questions on current occupation in Y16a-Y16k.
.....
For Respondents with an initial employment status in Y6
which is not 1 or 2, the employment/occupation series 
continues by asking about past or recent occupation and, 
if initial employment status is not 4 (Unemployed), asking
specifically whether the Respondent is currently working or 
not; when the answer to the latter question is yes (R is 
currently working), then the Y16a-Y16k questions on current 
occupation are administered too.
