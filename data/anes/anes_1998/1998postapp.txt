>> 1998 CENSUS OCCUPATION CODE

The full 3-digit 1990 Census Occupation Code was used to
code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
the amount of highly specific information released about
respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
sub-headings in the Census Code.

Users who need access to the full 3-digit occupation code
for their research purposes should contact NES project staff
for details about how this could be arranged.

In the code description that follows, the full 1990 Census
Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
(ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
occupations have been recoded.  For example, purchasing
managers (009), legislators (003), and funeral directors
(019) have all been recoded to (01).  Numbers in parentheses
following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
"N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

>> 1998 CENSUS DEFINITIONS - 1998 CENSUS

          THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS
          USED BY THE 1990 U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION:

               Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas
               Urbanized Areas
               Places
               Incorporated Places
               Unincorporated Places

          1. "METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSA's):"

          The general concept of a metropolitan area is one of a large
          population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that
          have a high degree of economic and social integration with
          that nucleus.

          In 1990 the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
          the U.S. Census have used the term Metropolitan Statistical
          Area (MSA) for what in 1980 was referred to as Standard
          Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).  An attempt has been
          made by the study staff to be consistent in using the newer
          terms in the current documentation and definitions.  The
          definitions of characteristics to be classified as a
          metropolitan area have remained fairly consistent--with only
          minor changes between 1980 and 1990.  However, due to
          changes in population size and density, employment,
          commuting and other behavior which defines metropolitan
          areas, the specific geographical composition of any given
          metropolitan area has, of course, frequently changed.  The
          specific MSA title may also have changed as to which cities
          are named and in what order.

          Each MSA has one or more central counties containing the
          area's main population concentration: an urganized area with
          at least 50,000 inhabitants.  An MSA may also include
          outlying counties that have close economic and social
          relationships with the central counties.  The outlying
          counties must have a specified level of commuting to the
          central counties and must also meet certain standards
          regarding metropolitan character, such as population
          density, urban population and population growth.  In New
          England, MSA's are composed of cities and towns rather than
          whole counties.

          The population living in MSA's may also be referred to as
          the metropolitan population.  The population is subdivided
          into "inside central city (or cities)" and "outside central
          city (or cities)."  (The population living outside MSA's
          constitutes the non-metropolitan population.)  Most MSA's
          have one to three CENTRAL CITIES that are named in the
          census title of the MSA.

          2. "CONSOLIDATED METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (CMSA's):"

          In some parts of the country, metropolitan development has
          progressed to the point that adjoining MSA's are themselves
          socially and economically interrelated.  These areas are
          designated consolidated metropolitan statistical areas
          (CMSA's) by the Office of Management and Budget, and are
          defined using standards included as part of the new MSA
          standards described above.  MSA's that are a part of a CMSA
          are referred to as primary metropolitan statistical areas
          (PMSA's).

          Definitions of the six largest CMSA's:

          * In the SRC 1980 National Sample (1992 NES sample).

          For the purpose of size and distance coding of suburbs and
          non-MSAs, the central cities of the six largest CMSAs are
          listed as:

               1.  New York City (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
                   Queens), NY, Elizabeth, NJ and Newark, NJ

               2.  Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena, Pomona, Burbank,
                   Anaheim, Santa Ana, Riverside, San Bernardino and
                   Palm Springs, CA.

               3.  Chicago, Evanston and Chicago Heights, Aurora,
                   Elgin, Joliet, Waukegan and North Chicago, IL

               4.  San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Livermore, CA

               5.  Philadelphia and Norristown, PA and Camden, NJ

               6.  Detroit, Dearborn, Pontiac and Port Huron, MI

          Both the CMSA definitions and the central city designations
          above are from Metropolitan Statistical Areas, 1990, U.S.
          Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC (Jun 1990)
          (PB90-214420)

          3. "URBANIZED AREAS:"

          The major objective of the Census Bureau in delineating
          urbanized areas is to provide a better separation of urban
          and rural population in the vicinity of large cities.  An
          urbanized area consists of a central city or cities, and
          surrounding closely settled territory ("urban fringe").

          4. "PLACES:"

          Two types of places are recognized in the census
          reports--incorporated places and unincorporated places,
          defined as follows:

          5. "INCORPORATED PLACES:"

          These are political units incorporated as cities, borought,
          towns and villages with the following exceptions: (a)
          boroughs in Alaska; and (b) towns in New York, Wisconsin and
          the New England states.

          6. "UNINCORPORATED PLACES:"

          The Census Bureau has delineated boundaries for closely
          settled population centers without corporate limits.  Each
          place so delineated possesses a definite nucleus of
          residences and has its boundaries drawn to include, if
          feasible, all the surrounding closely settled area.  These
          are called Census Designated Places (CDP's).
