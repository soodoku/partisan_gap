NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMING:                                                      
                                                                              
The variable name references used in NES Study codebooks do not include       
the "V" prefix found in all variable names used within the released           
SAS and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).                     
                                                                              
For example, "VAR 920001" and "VAR VERSION" in Study codebooks refer to       
V920001 and VVERSION in the study data definition files.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
VARIABLE 'NUMBERING':                                                         
                                                                              
'Numbered' variables in NES timeseries datasets and in Pilot datasets         
(except the 1998 Pilot) comply with the following format:                     
                                                                              
     2-digit year prefix  +  4 digits  +  [opt] 1-char suffix.                
                                                                              
Examples:  1978 Post variable V780002; 1983 Pilot variable V832101.           
Note that for datasets including data from multiple studies, the 2-digit      
year prefix corresponds to the appropriate study year to which the            
variable is associated; for example, the 1983 Pilot dataset also includes     
1982 timeseries variables, for which the 2-digit prefix is 82.                
                                                                              
Non-time-series studies other than Pilots use 2-character mnemonic            
prefixes, for example variable VPS0048 in the 1988-1990-1992 Pooled           
Senate Study dataset.                                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
SPECIAL NOTE ON COLUMN LOCATIONS:

Some numeric variables use coding schemes that allow for code values
having a varying number of digits. In such instances, the number
of columns corresponding to the variable in the data file [.dat file] 
and in the column specifications  will be the width of the maximum value
occurring in the actual data, rather than the maximum width allowable
by the coding scheme.  For example, if codes 01-12 are allowed for a
numeric variable but all values in the data are less than 10, then the
number of columns corresponding to the variable within the ASCII data 
file will be 1.

                WARM TOWARD THE PERSON.  RATINGS BETWEEN 0 AND 50 DEGREES

                THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS RECOMMEND THAT DATA FROM THIS

                MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS.  THE RESPONSE OF EITHER DEMOCRAT

                REPUBLICANS IN PARTICULAR, BUT JUST TO THE GOVERNMENT IN      
                GENERAL.  WE WANT TO SEE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE IDEAS.

                THE GOVERNMENT PAYS TO WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK WHEN IT DECIDES  
                WHAT TO DO--A GOOD DEAL, SOME, OR NOT MUCH?

                Q.Y54.  THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK THESE DAYS ABOUT DIFFERENT     
                SOCIAL CLASSES.  MOST PEOPLE SAY THEY BELONG EITHER TO THE    
                MIDDLE CLASS OR TO THE WORKING CLASS.  DO YOU EVER THINK OF   
                YOURSELF AS BELONGING TO ONE OF THESE CLASSES?
