1986 NES POST-ELECTION SURVEY SAMPLE DESIGN

STUDY POPULATION

     The study population for the 1986 NES Post-Election Survey is defined to
include all United States citizens of voting age on or before the 1986
Election Day. Eligible citizens must have resided in housing units, other than
on military reservations, in the forty-eight coterminous states. This
definition excludes persons living in Alaska or Hawaii and requires eligible
persons to have been both a United States citizen and eighteen years of age on
or before November 4, 1986.

MULTI-STAGE AREA PROBABILITY SAMPLE DESIGN

     The 1986 NES Post-Election Survey is based on a multistage area 
probability sample selected from the Survey Research Center's (SRC) National
Sample design. Identification of the 1986 NES sample respondents was conducted
using a four stage sampling process-- a primary stage sampling of U.S.
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas(SMSA's) and counties, followed by a
second stage sampling of area segments, a third stage sampling of housing
units within sampled area segments and concluding with the random selection of
a single respondent from selected housing units. A detailed documentation of
the SRC National Sample is provided in the SRC publication titled, 1980 SRC
National Sample: Design and Development.

Primary-Stage Selection
                       
     The selection of primary stage sampling units (PSU's) [1], which
depending on the sample stratum are either SMSA's, single counties and or
groupings of small counties, is based on the county-level 1980 Census Reports
of Population and Housing.

     Primary stage units were assigned to 84 explicit strata based on
SMSA/Non-SMSA status, PSU size and geographic location. Sixteen of the 84
strata contain only a single self-representing PSU each of which is included
with certainty in the primary stage of sample selection. The remaining 68
nonself-representing strata contain more than one PSU. From each of these
nonself-representing strata, one PSU was sampled with probability
proportionate to its size (PPS) measured in 1980 occupied housing units.
     
     The full SRC National Sample design of 84 primary stage selections was
designed to be optimal for surveys roughly one and one-half times the size of
the 1986 NES Post-Election Survey. To permit the flexibility needed for
optimal design of smaller survey samples, the primary stage of the SRC
National Sample can be readily partitioned into smaller subsamples of PSU's. 
Each of the partitions represents a stratified subselection from the full 84
PSU design.

     The sample for the 1986 NES study is selected from the "two/thirds"
partition of the 1980 SRC National Sample. The "two/thirds sample" includes
the 16 self-representing SMSA primary areas and a stratified subsampling of
forty-five (of the sixty-eight) nonself-representing primary areas of the SRC
National Sample. Table 1 identifies the primary areas for the 1986 NES
Post-Election Survey by SMSA status and Region.

Secondary-Stage Selection of Area Segments

     The second stage of the 1980 National Sample was selected directly from
computerized files that were prepared from the 1980 Census summary tape file
series (STF1-B). The designated second-stage sampling units (SSUs), termed
"area segments", are comprised of census blocks in the metropolitan primary
areas and enumeration districts (ED's) in the rural non-SMSAs and rural areas
of SMSA primary areas. Each SSU block, block combination or enumeration
district was assigned a measure of size equal to the total 1980 occupied
housing unit count for the area (minimum = 50). Second stage sampling of area
segments was performed with probabilities proportionate to the assigned
measures of size.

     A three-step process of ordering the SSUs within the primary areas
produced an implicit stratification of the area segments in the second stage
sampling frame, stratified at the county level by geographic location and
population. Area segments were stratified within county at the Minor Civil
Division (MCD) level by size and income, and at the block and ED level by
location within the MCD or county. (For details, refer to the SRC publication, 
1980 National Sample: Design and Development.)

     Systematic PPS sampling was used to select the area segments from the
second stage sampling frame for each county. In the self-representing (SR)
PSU's the number of sample area segments varied in proportion to the size of
the primary stage unit, from a high of b=24 area segments in the SR New York
SMSA to a low of b=6 area segments in the smaller SR PSU's such as Minneapolis
and Atlanta. A total of b=6 area segments was selected from each of the a=45
nonself-representing (NSR) PSU's.

Third-Stage Selection Of Housing Units

     For each area segment selected in the second sampling stage, a listing
was made of all housing units located within the physical boundaries of the
segment. For segments with a very large number of expected housing units, all
housing units in a subselected part of the segment were listed. The final
equal probability sample of housing units for the 1986 NES Post-Election
Survey was systematically selected from the housing unit listings for the
sampled area segments.

     The overall probability of selection for 1986 NES Post-Election Survey
households is f=.0004125 or 4.125 in 10,000. The equal probability sample of
households was achieved by using the standard multi-stage sampling technique
of setting the sampling rate for selecting housing units within area segments
to be inversely proportional to the PPS probabilities (see above) used to
select the PSU and area segment.

Fourth-Stage Respondent Selection

     Within each sampled housing unit, the SRC interviewer prepared a
complete listing of all eligible household members. Using an objective 
procedure described by Kish (1949) [2] a single respondent was then selected
at random to be interviewed. Regardless of circumstances, no substitutions
were permitted for the designated respondent.

SAMPLE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

     The targeted completed interview sample size for the 1986 NES
Post-Election Survey was n=2400 cases. In the original sample size
computation, the following assumptions were made: response rate = .72,
combined occupancy/eligibility rate = .87, and new construction update
inflation factor = 1.03. These assumptions were derived from survey experience
in the 1984 NES Pre-Post Election Survey. Table 2 provides a full description
of the original sample design specifications.

SAMPLE DESIGN OUTCOMES
     As seen in comparing the first column of Table 2 with the second column,
the assumption as to the sample growth from the update procedure resulted in
slightly more sample HU listings than expected. However, the original sample
design specifications overestimated the actual response and
occupancy/eligibility rates. Consequently, the final number of interviews was
less than anticipated. The occupancy/eligibility rate was lower than
anticipated from comparable 1984 NES figures; thus yielding 118 fewer eligible
households than expected. The actual response rate was also substantially
lower than expected for the 1986 NES. The underestimates of actual
occupancy/eligibility and response rate combined to produce 224 fewer
completed interviews than had been targeted in the original sample design
specifications.

WEIGHTED ANALYSIS OF 1986 NES DATA

     The area probability sample design for the 1986 NES results in an equal
probability sample of U.S. households. However, within sample households a
single adult respondent is chosen at random to be interviewed. Since the
number of eligible adults may vary from one household to another, the random
selection of a single adult introduces inequality into respondents' selection
probabilities. In analysis, a respondent selection weight should be used to
compensate for these unequal selection probabilities. The value of the
respondent selection weight is exactly equal to the number of eligible adults
in the household from which the random respondent was selected. The use of
the respondent selection weight is strongly encouraged, despite past
evaluations which have shown these weights to have little significant impact
on the values of NES estimates of descriptive statistics.

     The current policy of the National Election Studies is not to include in
public use data sets special analysis weights designed to compensate for
nonresponse or to post-stratify the sample to known population distribution
controls. Analysts interested in developing their own nonresponse or
post-stratification adjustment factors must request access to the necessary
sample control data from the NES Board.

SAMPLING ERRORS OF 1986 NES ESTIMATES

Sampling Error Calculation Programs

     The probability sample design for the 1986 National Election Study
permits the calculation of estimates of sampling error for survey statistics. 
For calculating sampling errors of statistics from complex sample surveys, the
OSIRIS statistical analysis and data management software system offers the
PSALMS and REPERR programs. PSALMS is a general purpose sampling error program
which incorporates the Taylor Series approximation approach to the estimation
of variances of ratios (including means, scale variables, indices,
proportions) and their differences. REPERR is an OSIRIS program which
incorporates algorithms for replicated approaches to variance estimation. 
Both Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) and Jackknife Repeated Replication
(JRR) are available as program options. The current version of REPERR is best
suited for estimating sampling errors and design effects for regression and
correlation statistics.

Sampling Error Codes and Calculation Model

     Estimation of variances for complex sample survey estimates requires a
computation model. Individual data records must be assigned sampling error
codes which reflect the complex structure of the sample and are compatible
with the computation algorithms of the various programs.  The sampling error
codes for the 1986 NES are included as variable #36 in the ICPSR Public Use
data set. The assigned sampling error codes are designed to facilitate
sampling error computation according to a paired selection model for both
Taylor Series approximation and Replication method programs.

     Table 3 provides a description of how individual sampling error code
values are to be paired for sampling error computations. Forty-one (41) pairs
or strata of sampling error computation units (SECU's) are defined. Each SECU
in a stratum pair includes cases assigned to a single sampling error code
value. The exception is the second SECU in stratum 40 which is comprised of
cases assigned sampling code values 62 and 63.

Generalized Sampling Error Results for the 1986 NES
     
     To assist 1986 NES analysts, the OSIRIS PSALMS program was used to
compute sampling errors for a wide-ranging example set of means and
proportions estimated from the 1986 NES Post-election Survey data set. For
each estimate, sampling errors were computed for the total sample and for
fifteen demographic and political affiliation subclasses of the 1986 NES
Post-Election Survey sample. The results of these sampling error computations
were then summarized and translated into the general usage sampling error
table provided in Table 4.

     Incorporating the pattern of "design effects" observed in the extensive
set of example computations, Table 4 provides approximate standard errors for
percentage estimates based on the 1986 NES. To use the table, examine the
column heading to find the percentage value which best approximates the value
of the estimated percentage that is of interest [5].  Next, locate the
approximate sample size base (denominator for the proportion) in the left-hand
row margin of the table. To find the approximate standard error of a
percentage estimate, simply cross-reference the appropriate column
(percentage) and row (sample size base). Note: the tabulated values represent
approximately one standard error for the percentage estimate. To construct an
approximate confidence interval, the analyst should apply the appropriate
critical point from the "z" distribution (e.g. z=1.96 for a two-sided 95%
confidence interval half-width). F urthermore, the approximate standard errors
in the table apply only to single point estimates of percentages not to the
difference between two percentage estimates.

     The generalized variance results presented in Table 4 are a useful tool
for initial, cursory examination of the NES survey results. For more indepth
analysis and reporting of critical estimates, analysts are encouraged to
compute exact estimates of standard errors using the appropriate choice of a
sampling error program and computation model.

>>  1980 CENSUS DEFINITIONS

                THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED BY THE 1980
                U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION.

                      STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (SMSA'S):

                THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF A METROPOLITAN AREA IS ONE OF A LARGE
                POPULATION NUCLEUS, TOGETHER WITH ADJACENT COMMUNITIES WHICH
                HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION WITH
                THAT NUCLEUS.

                EACH SMSA HAS ONE OR MORE CENTRAL COUNTIES CONTAINING THE
                AREA'S MAIN POPULATION CONCENTRATION: AN URBANIZED AREA WITH
                AT LEAST 50,000 INHABITANTS.  AN SMSA MAY ALSO INCLUDE
                OUTLYING COUNTIES WHICH HAVE CLOSE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
                RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CENTRAL COUNTIES.  THE OUTLYING
                COUNTIES MUST HAVE A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMMUTING TO THE
                CENTRAL COUNTIES AND MUST ALSO MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS
                REGARDING METROPOLITAN CHARACTER, SUCH AS POPULATION
                DENSITY, URBAN POPULATION AND POPULATION GROWTH.  IN NEW
                ENGLAND, SMSA'S ARE COMPOSED OF CITIES AND TOWNS RATHER THAN
                WHOLE COUNTIES.

                THE POPULATION LIVING IN SMSA'S MAY ALSO BE REFERRED TO AS
                THE METROPOLITAN POPULATION.  THE POPULATION IS SUBDIVIDED
                INTO "INSIDE CENTRAL CITY (OR CITIES)" AND "OUTSIDE CENTRAL
                CITY (OR CITIES)."  (THE POPULATION LIVING OUTSIDE SMSA'S
                CONSTITUTES THE NON-METROPOLITAN POPULATION.)  MOST SMSA'S
                HAVE ONE TO THREE CENTRAL CITIES WHICH ARE NAMED IN THE
                CENSUS TITLE OF THE SMSA.

                      STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS (SCSA'S):

                IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT HAS
                PROGRESSED TO THE POINT THAT ADJOINING SMSA'S ARE THEMSELVES
                SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY INTERRELATED.  THESE AREAS ARE
                DESIGNATED STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS (SCSA'S)
                BY THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET, AND ARE DEFINED
                USING STANDARDS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE NEW SMSA STANDARDS
                DESCRIBED ABOVE.

                            DEFINITIONS OF THE SIX LARGEST SCSA'S:

                (SOURCE:  TABLE 2 OF 1980 CENSUS OF POPULATION PC80-S1-5,
                STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND STANDARD
                CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS:  1980.)

                FOR THE PURPOSE OF SIZE AND DISTANCE CODING OF SUBURBS AND
                NON-SMSA'S, THE CENTRAL CITIES OF THE FIVE LARGEST SCSA'S
                ARE LISTED AS: NEW YORK (MANHATTAN), LOS ANGELES, CHICAGO,
                PHILADELPHIA, SAN FRANCISCO, AND DETROIT.

                URBANIZED AREAS: THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF THE CENSUS BUREAU IN
                DELINEATING URBANIZED AREAS IS TO PROVIDE A BETTER
                SEPARATION OF URBAN AND RURAL POPULATION IN THE VICINITY OF
                LARGE CITIES.  AN URBANIZED AREA CONSISTS OF A CENTRAL CITY
                OR CITIES, AND SURROUNDING CLOSELY SETTLED TERRITORY ("URBAN
                FRINGE").

                PLACES (IN THESE MATERIALS CALLED CENSUS PLACES):  TWO TYPES
                OF PLACES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CENSUS REPORTS--
                INCORPORATED PLACES AND UNINCORPORATED PLACES, DEFINED AS
                FOLLOWS:

                INCORPORATED PLACES--THESE ARE POLITICAL UNITS INCORPORATED
                AS CITIES, BOROUGHS, TOWNS AND VILLAGES WITH THE FOLLOWING
                EXCEPTIONS: (A) BOROUGHS IN ALASKA; AND (B) TOWNS IN NEW
                YORK, WISCONSIN AND THE NEW ENGLAND STATES.

                UNINCORPORATED PLACES--THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS DELINEATED
                BOUNDARIES FOR CLOSELY SETTLED POPULATION CENTERS WITHOUT
                CORPORATE LIMITS.  EACH PLACE SO DELINEATED POSSESSES A
                DEFINITE NUCLEUS OF RESIDENCES AND HAS ITS BOUNDARIES DRAWN
                TO INCLUDE, IF FEASIBLE, ALL THE SURROUNDING CLOSELY SETTLED
                AREA.



>> NES 1986 PARTY/CANDIDATE NOTE

                THIS NOTE IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH VARIABLES WHICH RECORD
                WHAT THE RESPONDENT LIKES AND DISLIKES ABOUT THE POLITICAL
                PARTIES AND A NUMBER OF PROMINENT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES.
                THE CODES HAVE BEEN REVISED FROM THE 1980 ELECTION STUDY.

                  ANY CATEGORY IN THE ENTIRE MASTER-CODE SET CAN BE A
                  REASON FOR LIKING OR DISLIKING SOMEONE, AND MOST CATE-
                  GORIES CAN REFER AS WELL TO PARTIES AND CANDIDATES.  FOR
                  EXAMPLE, "VERY LIBERAL IDEAS" CAN LOGICALLY BE A REASON
                  FOR LIKING OR DISLIKING EITHER PARTY OR EITHER CANDI-
                  DATE.  WHICH OF THE EIGHT LIKE/DISLIKE-PARTY/CANDIDATE
                  FIELDS A RESPONSE FALLS INTO CAN BE DETERMINED NORMALLY
                  BY THE QUESTION IT REFERS TO.

                  THE REASONS ARE BROKEN UP INTO SERIES OF HUNDREDS,
                  ACCORDING TO THE CONTENT AREA OF THE RESPONSE:

                       99 HUNDRED SERIES---------------MISSING DATA CODES

                  A RESPONSE WAS NOT CODED AS REFERRING TO A
                  PARTY OR CANDIDATE UNLESS THE PARTY OR CANDIDATE WAS
                  ACTUALLY MENTIONED.  THAT IS, IF THE RESPONDENT LIKED
                  THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THEY ARE FIRM ON COMMUNISM, THIS
                  RESPONSE WAS NOT ALSO CODED AS A DISLIKE OF DEMOCRATS
                  BECAUSE THEY ARE SOFT ON COMMUNISM, UNLESS THIS WAS ALSO
                  CLEARLY STATED.  EVEN A COMPARATIVE REFERENCE SUCH AS
                  THE REPUBLICANS ARE FIRMER ON COMMUNISM THAN THE DEMO-
                  CRATS, WAS CODED ONLY AS A PRO-REPUBLICAN RESPONSE.  IF
                  R SAID "REPUBLICANS ARE FIRM ON COMMUNISM, DEMOCRATS ARE
                  NOT," BOTH RESPONSES WERE CODED.

>>  NES 1986 EDUCATION AND OCCUPATION RECODES

                THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE RECODING AND REORGANIZATION DONE
                WITHIN THE EDUCATION AND OCCUPATION VARIABLES.

                IN THE ORIGINAL CPS VERSION OF THE EDUCATION SERIES,
                QUESTIONS WERE FIRST ASKED ABOUT THE RESPONDENT'S OWN
                EDUCATION (Q.Y3-Y3B,Y3X). FOLLOWING THOSE ITEMS, THE
                RESPONDENT WAS ASKED EITHER ABOUT THE EDUCATION LEVEL OF THE
                HEAD OF THE FAMILY (IF THE REPONDENT WAS NOT HEAD OF THE
                FAMILY) OR ABOUT THE EDUCATION LEVEL OF RESPONDENT'S
                SPOUSE/PARTNER (IF THE RESPONDENT WAS HEAD AND MARRIED). THE
                DATA FOR THE HEAD/SPOUSE/PARTNER SERIES WERE COMBINED
                INTO Q.Y3D-Y3F AND Q.Y3XX.  THE ICPSR VERSION OF THE DATA
                HAS BROKEN THIS SERIES INTO TWO DISTINCT SETS. THE FIRST SET
                CONTAINS THE "HEAD OF FAMILY" EDUCATION VARIABLES WHICH
                COMBINES THE DATA FOR RESPONDENTS WHO ARE HEADS OF FAMILIES
                WITH THE DATA ASKED ABOUT THE HEAD OF FAMILY FOR THOSE
                REPONDENTS WHO ARE NOT HEADS OF FAMILIES.  THE SECOND SET OF
                VARIABLES CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT SPOUSE/PARTNER
                EDUCATION. THUS V604-V607 CONTAIN THE HEAD OF FAMILY
                EDUCATION DATA AND V608-V611 CONTAIN THE RESPONDENT'S
                SPOUSE/PARTNER EDUCATION DATA.

                THE OCCUPATION CODING IN 1986 DIFFERS FROM WHAT WAS DONE IN
                PAST ELECTION STUDIES.  FIRST, ONLY THE 1980 OCCUPATION AND
                INDUSTRY CODES ARE PROVIDED.  SECOND, THE OCCUPATION CODING
                HAS BEEN RELEASED IN LESS DETAIL THAN IN YEARS PAST.  THE
                DATASET INCLUDES ONLY TWO-DIGIT CODES FOR OCCUPATIONAL
                CATEGORY WHERE IN THE PAST THE THREE-DIGIT CENSUS BUREAU
                CODES WERE PROVIDED.  THE TWO-DIGIT CODES REPRESENT A TOTAL
                OF 71 OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES DERIVED FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU
                MAJOR OCCUPATIONAL GROUP HEADINGS.  THOSE WHO HAVE NEED OF
                THE FULL OCCUPATION CODE FOR THEIR RESEARCH SHOULD CONTACT
                THE NES PROJECT STAFF FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS
                UNDER WHICH ACCESS TO THESE DATA MAY BE PROVIDED.

                THE OCCUPATION AND WORK SERIES WAS ASKED OF THE RESPONDENT.
                IF THE RESPONDENT WAS NOT HEAD OF THE FAMILY, A PARALLEL
                SERIES OF ITEMS WAS ASKED ABOUT THE HEAD OF FAMILY'S OCCUPATIO
                AND WORK. NO SPOUSE/PARTNER OCCUPATION INFORMATION WAS
                COLLECTED AS WAS DONE IN PAST YEARS. ONE ITEM ON
                SPOUSE/PARTNER WORK STATUS WAS ASKED AND CAN BE FOUND IN
                QY3H, V613.

                SIMILAR TO THE "HEAD OF FAMILY" EDUCATION SERIES, A "HEAD OF
                FAMILY" OCCUPATION SERIES WAS CONSTRUCTED (QY27-QY46A).  THE
                ICPSR VERSION OF THIS SERIES OF ITEMS INCLUDES INFORMATION
                FOR ALL HEADS OF FAMILIES WHICH COMBINES DATA FROM THOSE
                RESPONDENTS WHO ARE HEADS OF FAMILIES WITH THOSE WHO WERE
                NOT HEADS OF FAMILY BUT WERE QUERIED ABOUT THEIR HEAD OF
                FAMILY'S WORK AND OCCUPATION.

                THERE ARE TWO OTHER RECODED SERIES OF VARIABLES CONCERNING
                OCCUPATION AND WORK WHICH ARE THE ICPSR "STACKED" VARIABLES
                FOR RESPONDENT AND HEAD OF FAMILY.  IN THE OCCUPATION
                SECTION, RESPONDENTS ARE FIRST ASKED A LEAD-IN QUESTION
                ABOUT THEIR CURRENT WORK STATUS (E.G. EMPLOYED, TEMPORARILY
                LAID OFF, UNEMPLOYED, RETIRED, PERMANENTLY DISABLED,
                HOMEMAKER, STUDENT). THEN, THE RESPONDENT WAS ASKED THE
                OCCUPATION AND WORK QUESTIONS RELEVANT TO HIS/HER CURRENT
                WORK STATUS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE RESPONDENT WAS UNEMPLOYED,
                HE/SHE WOULD BE ASKED THE QUESTIONS FROM THE UNEMPLOYED
                SECTION CONCERNING THE REPONDENT'S LAST REGULAR JOB.
                ALTHOUGH THE QUESTIONS ASKED DEPENDING ON WORK STATUS DIFFER
                SLIGHTLY, MANY OF THE ITEMS ASKED ARE PARALLEL, ALBEIT WITH
                SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WORDINGS TO SUIT THE WORK STATUS
                INDICATED BY THE RESPONDENT. IT HAS BEEN ICPSR PRACTICE TO
                "STACK" RESPONSES TO PARALLEL SERIES OF QUESTIONS INTO
                VARIABLES WHICH INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT WORK AND
                OCCUPATION FOR ALL RESPONDENTS OVER ALL WORK STATUS
                CATEGORIES.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS ARE THOSE
                RESPONDENTS WHO ARE HOMEMAKERS AND/OR STUDENTS WITHOUT
                OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT (WHO ARE CODED INAP. THROUGHOUT THE
                STACKED VARIABLE SERIES).

                THE "HEAD OF FAMILY" OCCUPATION SERIES IS STACKED IN THE
                SAME FASHION.  THE "HEAD" OF FAMILY STACKED SERIES COMBINES
                DATA FROM RESPONDENTS WHO ARE HEADS OF FAMILIES WITH THE
                DATA ABOUT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PROVIDED BY RESPONDENTS WHO
                WERE NOT HEADS OF FAMILIES THEMSELVES.

                THE ICPSR RELEASE OF THE 1986 POST-ELECTION FILE INCLUDES
                THE ORIGINAL OCCUPATION AND WORK ITEMS IN UNSTACKED FORMAT
                AS WELL AS THE STACKED VERSIONS OF SOME OF THESE VARIABLES.
                RESPONDENT UNSTACKED ITEMS CAN BE FOUND IN V614-V661.
                STACKED RESPONDENT ITEMS ARE IN V663-V674.  UNSTACKED "HEAD OF
                FAMILY" ITEMS ARE IN V675-V718 AND STACKED "HEAD OF FAMILY"
                ITEMS ARE IN V719-V728.







>>  1980 CENSUS OCCUPATION CODES


                CODING OF OCCUPATION IN THE 1986 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY

                THE FULL 3-DIGIT 1980 CENSUS BUREAU OCCUPATION CODE WAS USED
                TO CODE THE OCCUPATION OF RESPONDENTS.  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE
                THE AMOUNT OF HIGHLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELEASED ABOUT
                RESPONDENTS, THE FULL OCCUPATION CODE HAS BEEN RECODED TO A
                71 CATEGORY CODE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE OCCUPATION CODE
                SUB-HEADINGS IN THE CENSUS CODE.

                USERS WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE FULL 3-DIGIT OCCUPATION CODE
                FOR THEIR RESEARCH PURPOSES SHOULD CONTACT NES PROJECT STAFF
                FOR DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS COULD BE ARRANGED.

                IN THE CODE DESCRIPTION WHICH FOLLOWS, THE FULL 1980 CENSUS
                CODE IS PRESENTED.  AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH RECODED
                SECTION, THE STATEMENT 'CENSUS CODES (XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE
                RECODED TO (ZZ)' APPEARS TO INDICATE THE CODE VALUES TO

                CITIES WITH POPULATION OF 25,000 OR MORE
                (FOR USE ON 1982 POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION STUDY)

                THIS LIST WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE 1973 WORLD ALMANAC AND BOOK
                OF FACTS, PP. 152-188 (1970 POPULATION FIGURES).

                THE FIRST FOUR DIGITS ARE A UNIQUE CODE NUMBER FOR EACH
                CITY. THE FIFTH DIGIT IS THE URBANICITY CODE FOR EACH CITY,
                AS USED IN THE 1971 QUALITY OF LIFE STUDY (468110).

                1 = CITY OF OVER 1,000,000
                2 = CITY OF OVER 25,000 AND UP TO 250,000 IN AN SMSA OF
                     1,000,000 OR MORE
                3 = CITY OF UNDER 25,000 IN AN SMSA OF 1,000,000 OR MORE
                4 = CITY OF OVER 250,000 AND UP TO 1,000,000

                * PLACE ADDED IN 1982 (HAVING POPULATION OF 25,000+ IN 1980
                CENSUS) CODED ON BASIS OF 1970 STATUS IN AREA.  (SEE EXAMPLE
                CHANDLER, ARIZONA -- IT'S SMSA WAS NOT OVER ONE MILLION IN
                1970, SO CODED 6 HERE.  THIS WAS DONE TO AVOID GLARING
                INCONSISTENCIES IN ADJACENT AREAS.  THE AREAS AFFECTED BY
                THIS DECISION ARE THE FOUR PLACES WHERE THE POPULATION OF
