NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMING:                                                      
                                                                              
The variable name references used in NES Study codebooks do not include       
the "V" prefix found in all variable names used within the released           
SAS and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).                     
                                                                              
For example, "VAR 920001" and "VAR VERSION" in Study codebooks refer to       
V920001 and VVERSION in the study data definition files.

                RESPONDENTS ASSIGNED TO FORM A OR FORM B.  ERRORS FOUND FELL

                - THE CHECKPOINT WAS MARKED CORRECTLY, BUT THE RESPONDENT     
                WAS ASKED THE WRONG SET OF QUESTIONS.  RESPONSES TO THE       
                QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED WERE CODED AS       
                INAP.  THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON MISTAKE.               
                                                                              
                - THE CHECKPOINT WAS MARKED INCORRECTLY BUT THE SERIES WAS    
                CORRECTLY ADMINISTERED.  IN THIS CASE, THE CHECKPOINT WAS     
                CORRECTED DURING CODING.                                      
                                                                              
                - THE CHECKPOINT WAS MARKED INCORRECTLY AND WRONG SERIES      
                ASKED.  THE CHECKPOINT WAS CORRECTED IN CODING, THE           
                INCORRECT SERIES WAS CODED AS INAP; AND THE SERIES NOT ASKED  
                WAS CODED AS NOT ASCERTAINED.

                RECENT ELECTIONS, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS.        
                FIRST, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS    
                WHICH TOOK PLACE THIS ELECTION YEAR.                          
                                                                              
                Q.A1. SOME PEOPLE DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO POLITICAL       
                CAMPAIGNS. HOW ABOUT YOU?  WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE VERY   
                MUCH INTERESTED, SOMEWHAT INTERESTED, OR NOT MUCH INTERESTED  
                IN FOLLOWING THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS THIS YEAR?

                Q.B12. (R.B., P. 3) I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD      
                SOME OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE IN     
                THE NEWS THESE DAYS.  I WILL USE SOMETHING WE CALL THE        
                FEELING THERMOMETER AND HERE IS HOW IT WORKS:                 
                                                                              
                I'LL READ THE NAME OF A PERSON AND I'D LIKE YOU TO RATE THAT  
                PERSON USING THE FEELING THERMOMETER.  RATINGS BETWEEN 50     
                DEGREES AND 100 DEGREES MEAN THAT YOU FEEL FAVORABLE AND      
                WARM TOWARD THE PERSON.  RATINGS BETWEEN 0 DEGREES AND 50     
                DEGREES MEAN THAT YOU DON'T FEEL FAVORABLE TOWARD THE PERSON  
                AND THAT YOU DON'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR THAT PERSON.             
                                                                              
                YOU WOULD RATE THE PERSON AT THE 50 DEGREE MARK IF YOU DON'T  
                FEEL PARTICULARLY WARM OR COLD TOWARD THE PERSON.  IF WE      
                COME TO A PERSON WHOSE NAME YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE, YOU DON'T    
                NEED TO RATE THAT PERSON. JUST TELL ME AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO   
                THE NEXT ONE. OUR FIRST PERSON IS RONALD REAGAN.  HOW WOULD   
                YOU RATE HIM USING THE THERMOMETER?

                Q.L1. (R.B., P. 7)  SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SPEND  
                MUCH LESS MONEY FOR DEFENSE.  SUPPOSE THESE PEOPLE ARE AT     
                ONE END OF THE SCALE AT POINT NUMBER 1.  OTHERS FEEL THAT     
                DEFENSE SPENDING SHOULD BE GREATLY INCREASED.  SUPPOSE THESE  
                PEOPLE ARE AT THE OTHER END, AT POINT 7.  AND, OF COURSE,     
                SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN AT

                PRESSURE TO GET THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS    
                RACIAL LAWS.  OTHERS THINK THAT THE U.S. SHOULD NOT DO THIS.

                OR NOT?

           this office is organized, it would take an infinite amount of time
